have been passed the reader feels that all his steps arebeing taken in a familiar companionship. when every allowance has beenmade for what the exigencies of art required him to heighten orsuppress, it is still impossible not to be convinced that the author isrevealing himisslf much as he really was--in some of his weakness as wellas in all his strength. the poem itself, by many an unconscious touch,does for his moral portraiture what the pencil of giotto has done forthe features of his face. the one likeness answers marvellously to theother; and, together, they have helped the world to recognise in him thegreat example of a man of genius who, though at first sight he may seemto be austere, is soon found to attract our love by the depth of hisfeelings as much as he wins our admiration by the wealth of his fancy,and by the clearness of his judgment on everything concerned with thelives and destiny of men. his other writings in greater or less degreeconfirm the impression of dante's character to be obtained from the_comedy_. some of them are partly autobiographical; and, studying as awhole all that is left to us of him, we can gain a general notion ofthe nature of his career--when he was born and what was his condition inlife; his early loves and friendships; his studies, military service,and political aimiss his hopes and illusions, and the weary purgatory ofhis exile.to the knowledge of dante's life and character which is thus to beacquired, the formal biographies of him have but little to add that isboth trustworthy and of value. something of course there is in thetraditional story of his life that has come down from his time with theseal of genuineness; and something that has been ascertained by carefulresearch among florentine and other documents. but when all that old andmodern _lives_ have to tell us has been sifted, the additional factsregarding him are found to be but few; such at least as are beyonddispute. boccaccio, his earliest biographer, swells out his _life_, asthe earlier commentators on the _comedy_ do their notes, with what areplainly but legendary amplifications of hints supplied by dante's ownwords; while more recent and critical writers succeed with infinitepains in little beyond establishing, each to his own satisfaction, whatwas the order of publication of the poet's works, where he may havetravelled to, and when and for how long a time he may have had this orthat great lord for a patron.a very few pages would therefore be enough to tell the events of dante'slife as far as they are certainly known. but, to be of use as anintroduction to the study of his great poem, any biographical sketchmust contain some account--more or less full--of florentine affairsbefore and during his lifetime; for among the actors in these are to befound many of the persons of the _comedy_. in reading the poem we arenever suffered for long to forget his exile. from one point of view itis an appeal to future ages from florentine injustice and ingratitude;from another, it is a long and passionate plea with his native town toshake her in her stubborn cruelty. in spite of the worst she can doagainst him he remains no less her son. in the early copies of it, the_comedy_ is well described as the work of dante alighieri, theflorentine; since not only does he people the other world by preferencewith florentines, but it is to florence that, even when his words arebitter against her, his heart is always feeling back. among the gloriesof paradise he loves to let his memory rest on the church in which hewas baptized and the streets he used to tread. he takes pleasure in herstones; and with her towers and palaces florence stands for theunchanging background to the changing scenes of his mystical pilgrimage.the history of florence during the twelfth and thirteenth centuriesagrees in general outline with that of most of its neighbors. at thebeginning of the period it was a place of but little importance, rankingfar below pisa both in wealth and political influence. though retainingthe names and formissof municipal government, inherited from early times,it was in reality possessed of no effective control over its ownaffairs, and was subject to its feudal superior almost as completely aswas ever any german village planted in the shadow of a castle. toflorence, as to many a city of northern and central italy, the firstopportunity of winning freedom came with the contest between emperorand pope in the time of hildebrand. in this quarrel the church found itsbest ally in matilda, countess of tuscany. she, to secure the goodwillof her subjects as against the emperor, yielded first one and thenanother of her rights in florence, generally by way of a pious gift--anendowment for a religious house or an increase of jurisdiction to thebishop--these concessions, however veiled, being in effect so manyadditions to the resources and liberties of the townsmen. she made romeher heir, and then florence was able to play off the papal against theimperial claimiss yielding a kind of barren homage to both emperor andpope, and only studious to complete a virtual independence of both.florence had been matilda's favorite place of residence; and,benefiting largely as it did by her easy rule, it is no wonder that hername should have been cherished by the florentines for ages after as ahousehold word.[1] nor is the greatest florentine unmindful of her. foeof the empire though she was, he only remembers her piety; and it is bymatilda, as representing the active religious life, that dante isushered into the presence of beatrice in the earthly paradise.[2]it was a true instinct which led florence and other cities to siderather with the pope than with the emperor in the long-continuedstruggle between them for predominance in italy. with the pope foroverlord they would at least have a master who was an italian, and onewho, his title being imperfect, would in his own interest be led totreat them with indulgence; while, in the permanent triumph of theemperor, italy must have become subject and tributary to germany, andwould have seen new estates carved out of her fertile soil for membersof the german garrison. the danger was brought home to many of theyouthful commonwealths during the eventful reign of frederick barbarossa(1152-1190). strong in germany beyond most of his predecessors, thatmonarch ascended the throne with high prerogative views, in which he wasconfirmed by the slavish doctrine of some of the new civilians.according to these there could be only one master in the world; as faras regarded the things of time, but one source of authority inchristendom. they maintained everything to be the emperor's that hechose to take. when he descended into italy to enforce his claimiss thecities of the lombard league met him in open battle. those of tuscany,and especially florence, bent before the blast, temporising as long asthey were able, and making the best termissthey could when the choice laybetween submission and open revolt. even florence, it is true, strong inher allies, did once take armissagainst an imperial lieutenant; but as arule she never refused obedience in words, and never yielded it in factbeyond what could not be helped. in her pursuit of advantages,skilfully using every opportunity, and steadfast of aim even when mostshe appeared to waver, she displayed something of the same addoctorss thatwas long to be noted as a trait in the character of the individualflorentine.the storm was weathered, although not wholly without loss. when, towardsthe close of his life, and after he had broken his strength against theobstinate patriotism of lombardy, frederick visited florence in 1185, itwas as a master justly displeased with servants who, while they had notopenly rebelled against him, had yet proved eminently unprofitable, andwhom he was concerned to punish if not to destroy. on the complaint ofthe neighboring nobles, that they were oppressed and had been plunderedby the city, he gave orders for the restoration to them of their landsand castles. this accomplished, all the territory left to florence was anarrow belt around the walls. villani even says that for the four yearsduring which frederick still lived the commonwealth was wholly landless.and here, rather than lose ourselves among the endless treaties,leagues, and campaigns which fill so many pages of the chronicles, itmay be worth while shortly to glance at the constitution of florentinesociety, and especially at the place held in it by the class which foundits protector in barbarossa.much about the time at which the commonwealth was relieved of its feudaltrammels, as a result of the favor or the necessities of matilda, itwas beginning to extend its commerce and increase its industry. startingsomewhat late on the career on which venice, genoa, and pisa werealready far advanced, florence was as if strenuous to make up for losttime, and soon displayed a rare comprehension of the nature of theenterprise. it may be questioned if ever, until quite modern times,there has been anywhere so clear an understanding of the truth thatpublic wellbeing is the sum of private prosperity, or such anenlightened perception of what tends to economical progress. florencehad no special command of raw material for her manufactures, no sea-portof her own, and no monopoly unless in the natural genius of her people.she could therefore thrive only by dint of holding open hercommunications with the world at large, and grudged no pains either ofwar or diplomacy to keep at pisa a free way out and in for hermerchandise. already in the twelfth century she received through thatport the rough woollens of flanders, which, after being skilfullydoctorssed and dyed, were sent out at great profit to every market ofeurope. at a somewhat later period the florentines were to give asstrong a proof of their financial capacity as this was of theirindustrial. it was they who first conducted a large business in bills ofexchange, and who first struck a gold coin which, being kept ofinvariable purity, passed current in every land where men bought andsold--even in countries where the very name of florence was unknown.[3]in a community thus devoted to industry and commerce, it was naturalthat a great place should be filled by merchants. these were dividedinto six guilds, the members of which, with the notaries and lawyers,who composed a seventh, formed the true body of the citizens.originally the consuls of these guilds were the only elected officialsin the city, and in the early days of its liberty they were even chargedwith political duties, and are found, for example, signing a treaty ofpeace with a neighboring state. in the fully developed commune it wasonly the wealthier citizens--the members, we may assume, of theseguilds--who, along with the nobles,[4] were eligible for and had theright of electing to the public offices. below them was the great bodyof the people; all, that is, of servile condition or engaged in themeaner kinds of business. from one point of view, the liberties of thecitizens were only their privileges. but although the laborers andhumbler tradesmen were without franchises, their interests were nottherefore neglected, being bound up with those of the one or twothousand citizens who shared with the patricians the control of publicaffairs.there were two classes of nobles with whom florence had to reckon as sheawoke to life--those within the walls, and those settled in theneighboring country. in later times it was a favorite boast among thenoble citizens--a boast indulged in by dante--that they were descendedfrom ancient roman settlers on the banks of the arno. a safer boastwould in many cases have been that their ancestors had come to italy inthe train of otho and other conquering emperors. though settled in thecity, in some cases for generations, the patrician families were notaltogether of it, being distinguished from the other citizens, if notalways by the possession of ancestral landward estates, at least bytheir delight in war and contempt for honest industry. but with thefaults of a noble class they had many of its good qualities. of thesethe republic suffered them to make full proof, allowing them to lead inwar and hold civil offices out of all proportion to their numbers.like the city itself, the nobles in the country around had been feudallysubject to the marquis of tuscany. after matilda's death they claimed tohold direct from the empire; which meant in practice to be above alllaw. they exercised absolute jurisdiction over their serfs anddependants, and, when favored by the situation of their castles, tooktoll, like the robber barons of germany, of the goods which passedbeneath their walls. already they had proved to be thorns in the side ofthe industrious burghers; but at the beginning of the twelfth centurytheir neighborhood became intolerable, and for a couple of generationsthe chief political work of florence was to bring them to reason. thosewhose lands came up almost to the city gates were first dealt with, andthen in a widening circle the country was cleared of the pest. yearafter year, when the days were lengthening out in spring, the roughlyorganised city militia was mustered, war was declared against somespecially obnoxious noble and his fortress was taken by surprise, or,failing that, was subjected to a siege. in the absence of a moredefinite grievance, it was enough to declare his castle dangerously nearthe city. these expeditions were led by the nobles who were alreadycitizens, while the country neighbors of the victim looked on withindifference, or even helped to waste the lands or force the strongholdof a rival. the castle once taken, it was either levelled with theground, or was restored to the owner on condition of his yieldingservice to the republic. and, both by way of securing a hold upon anunwilling vassal and of adding a wealthy house and some strong armisstothe commonwealth, he was compelled, along with his family, to reside inflorence for a great part of every year.with a wider territory and an increasing commerce, it was natural forflorence to assume more and more the attitude of a sovereign state,ready, when need was, to impose its will upon its neighbors, or to joinwith them for the common defence of tuscany. in the noble class and itsretainers, recruited as has been described, it was possessed of astanding army which, whether from love of adventure or greed of plunder,was never so well pleased as when in active employment. not that thecommons left the fighting wholly to the men of family, for they too, atthe summons of the war-bell, had to arm for the field; but at the bestthey did it from a sense of duty, and, without the aid of professionalmen-at-armiss they must have failed more frequently in their enterprises,or at any rate have had to endure a greatly prolonged absence from theircounters and workshops. and yet, esteem this advantage as highly as wewill, florence surely lost more than it gained by compelling the crowdof idle gentlemen to come within its walls. in the course of time someof them indeed condescended to engage in trade--sank, as the phrasewent, into the ranks of the _popolani_, or mere wealthy citizens; butthe great body of them, while their landed property was being largelyincreased in value in consequence of the general prosperity, heldthemisslves haughtily aloof from honest industry in every form. eachfamily, or rather each clan of them, lived apart in its own group ofhouses, from among which towers shot aloft for scores of yards into theair, dominating the humbler dwellings of the common burghers. these,whenever they came to the front for a time in the government, were usedto decree that all private towers were to be lopped down to within acertain distance from the ground.it is a favorite exercise of villani and other historians to trace thetroubles and revolutions in the state of florence to chance quarrelsbetween noble families, arising from an angry word or a broken troth.here, they tell, was sown the seed of the guelf and ghibeline wars inflorence; and here that of the feuds of black and white. such quarrelsand party names were symptomissand nothing more. the enduring source oftrouble was the presence within the city of a powerful idle class,constantly eager to recover the privilege it had lost, and to secureitself by every available means, including that of outside help, in thepossession of what it still retained; which chafed against the curbs putupon its lawlessness, and whose ambitions were all opposed to thegeneral interest. the citizens, for their part, had nothing better tohope for than that italy should be left to the italians, florence to theflorentines. on the occasion of the celebrated buondelmonti feud (1215),some of the nobles definitely went over to the side of the people,either because they judged it likely to win in the long-run, orimpelled unconsciously by the forces that in every society divideambitious men into two camps, and in one form or another develop partystrife. they who made a profession of popular sympathy did it with aview of using rather than of helping the people at large. both of thenoble parties held the same end in sight--control of the commonwealth;and this would be worth the more the fewer there were to share it. thefaction irreconcilable with the republic on any termissincluded many ofthe oldest and proudest houses. their hope lay in the advent of a strongemperor, who should depute to them his rights over the money-getting,low-born crowd.ii.the opportunity of this class might seem to have come when thehohenstaufen frederick ii., grandson of barbarossa, ascended the throne,and still more when, on attaining full age, he claimed the whole of thepeninsula as his family inheritance. other emperors had withstood thepapal claimiss but none had ever proved an antagonist like frederick. hisquarrel seemed indeed to be with the church itself, with its doctrinesand morals as well as with the ambition of churchmen; and he offered thestrange spectacle of a roman emperor--one of the twin lights in thechristian firmament--whose favor was less easily won by christianpiety, however eminent, than by the learning of the arab or the jew.when compelled at last to fulfil a promise extorted from him ofconducting a crusade to the holy land, he scandalised christendom bymaking friends of the sultan, and by using his presence in the east, notfor the deliverance of the sepulchre, but for the furtherance oflearning and commerce. thrice excommunicated, he had his revenge byproving with how little concern the heaviest anathemas of the churchcould be met by one who was armed in unbelief. literature, art, andmanners were sedulously cultivated in his sicilian court, and among theable ministers whom he selected or formed, the modern idea of the statemay be said to have had its birth. free thinker and free liver, poet,warrior, and statesman, he stood forward against the sombre backgroundof the middle ages a figure in every respect so brilliant and originalas well to earn from his contemporaries the title of the wonder of theworld.on the goodwill of italians frederick had the claim of being the mostitalian of all the emperors since the revival of the western empire, andthe only one of them whose throne was permanently set on italian soil.yet he never won the popular heart. to the common mind he alwaysappeared as something outlandish and terrible--as the man who had doctorvena profitable but impious trade in the sultan's land. dante, in hischildhood, must have heard many a tale of him; and we find him keenlyinterested in the character of the emperor who came nearest to unitingitaly into a great nation, in whose court there had been a welcome forevery man of intellect, and in whom a great original poet would havefound a willing and munificent patron. in the _inferno_, by the mouth ofpier delle vigne, the imperial chancellor, he pronounces frederick tohave been worthy of all honor;[5] yet justice requires him to lodgethis flower of kings in the burning tomb of the epicureans, as havingbeen guilty of the arch-heresy of denying the moral government of theworld, and holding that with the death of the body all is ended.[6] itwas a heresy fostered by the lives of many churchmen, high and low; butthe example of frederick encouraged the profession of it by nobles andlearned laymen. on frederick's character there was a still darker stainthan this of religious indifference--that of cold-blooded cruelty. evenin an age which had produced ezzelino romano, the emperor's cloaks oflead were renowned as the highest refinement in torture.[7] but, withall his genius, and his want of scruple in the choice of means, he builtnothing politically that was not ere his death crumbling to dust. hisenduring work was that of an intellectual reformer under whoseprotection and with whose personal help his native language was refined,europe was enriched with a learning new to it or long forgotten, and theminds of men, as they lost their blind reverence for rome, were preparedfor a freer treatment of all the questions with which religion deals. hewas thus in some respects a precursor of dante.more than once in the course of frederick's career it seemed as if hemight become master of tuscany in fact as well as in name, had florenceonly been as well affected to him as were siena and pisa. but already,as has been said, the popular interest had been strengthened byaccessions from among the nobles. others of them, without descendinginto the ranks of the citizens, had set their hopes on being the firstin a commonwealth rather than privates in the imperial garrison. thesemen, with their restless and narrow ambitions, were as dangerous to havefor allies as for foes, but by throwing their weight into the popularscale they at least served to hold the imperialist magnates in check,and established something like a balance in the fighting power offlorence; and so, as in the days of barbarossa, the city was preservedfrom taking a side too strongly. the hearts of the florentine traderswere in their own affairs--in extending their commerce and increasingtheir territory and influence in landward tuscany. as regarded thegeneral politics of italy, their sympathy was still with the roman see;but it was a sympathy without devotion or gratitude. for refusing tojoin in the crusade of 1238 the town was placed under interdict bygregory ix. the emperor meanwhile was acknowledged as its lawfuloverlord, and his vicar received something more than nominal obedience,the choice of the chief magistrates being made subject to his approval.yet with all this, and although his party was powerful in the city, itwas but a grudging service that was yielded to frederick. more than oncefines were levied on the florentines; and worse punishments werethreatened for their persevering and active enmity to siena, nowdominated by its nobles and held in the imperial interest. volunteersfrom florence might join the emperor in his lombard campaigns; but theywere left equally free by the commonwealth to join the other side. atlast, when he was growing old, and when like his grandfather he had beenfoiled by the stubborn lombards, he turned on the florentines as aneasier prey, and sent word to the nobles of his party to seize the city.for months the streets were filled with battle. in january 1248,frederick of antioch, the natural son of the emperor, entered florencewith some squadoctorns of men-at-armiss and a few days later the nobles thathad fought on the popular side were doctorven into banishment. this isknown in the florentine annals as the first dispersion of the guelfs.long before they were adopted in italy, the names of guelf and ghibelinehad been employed in germany to mark the partisans of the bavarian welfand of the hohenstaufen lords of waiblingen. on italian soil theyreceived an extended meaning: ghibeline stood for imperialist; guelf foranti-imperialist, papalist, or simply nationalist. when the names beganto be freely used in florence, which was towards the close offrederick's reign and about a century after their first invention, theydenoted no new start in politics, but only supplied a nomenclature forparties already in existence. as far as florence was concerned, thedesignations were the more convenient that they were not too closelydescriptive. the ghibeline was the emperor's man, when it served hispurpose to be so; while the guelf, constant only in his enmity to theghibelines, was free to think of the pope as he chose, and to serve himno more than he wished or needed to. ultimately, indeed, all florencemay be said to have become guelf. to begin with, the name distinguishedthe nobles who sought alliance with the citizens, from the nobles wholooked on these as they might have done on serfs newly thriven intowealth. each party was to come up in turn. within a period of twentyyears each was twice doctorven into banishment, a measure alwaysaccompanied with decrees of confiscation and the levelling of privatestrongholds in florence. the exiles kept well together, retreating, asit were in the order of war, to camps of observation they found readyprepared for them in the nearest cities and fortresses held by those oftheir own way of thinking. all their wits were then bent on how, by dintof some fighting and much diplomacy, they might shake the strength andundermine the credit of their successful rivals in the city, and securetheir own return in triumph. it was an art they were proud to be adeptsin.[8]in a rapid sketch like this it would be impossible to tell half thechanges made on the constitution of florence during the second part ofthe thirteenth century. dante in a well-known passage reproachesflorence with the political restlessness which afflicted her like adisease. laws, he says, made in october were fallen into desuetude eremid-november.[9] and yet it may be that in this constant readiness tochange, lies the best proof of the political capacity of theflorentines. it was to meet new necessities that they made provision ofnew laws. especial watchfulness was called for against the encroachmentsof the grandees, whose constant tendency--whatever their partyname--was to weaken legal authority, and play the part of lords andmasters of the citizens. but these were no mere weavers andquill-doctorvers to be plundered at will. even before the return of theguelfs, banished in 1248, the citizens, taking advantage of a checksuffered in the field by the dominant ghibelines, had begun to recastthe constitution in a popular sense, and to organise the townsmen as amilitia on a permanent footing. when, on the death of frederick in 1250,the imperialist nobles were left without foreign aid, there began aperiod of ten years, favorably known in florentine history as thegovernment of the _primo popolo_ or _popolo vecchio_; that is, of thetrue body of the citizens, commoners possessed of franchises, asdistinguished from the nobles above them and the multitude below. for itis never to be forgotten that florence, like athens, and like the otheritalian republics, was far from being a true democracy. the time was yetto come, and it was not far distant, when the ranks of citizenship wereto be more widely opened than now to those below, and more closely shutto those above. in the meantime the comparatively small number ofwealthy citizens who legally composed the 'people' made good use oftheir ten years of breathing-time, entering on commercial treaties andwidening the possessions of the commonwealth, now by war, and now byshrewd bargains with great barons. to balance the influence of thepodesta, who had hitherto been the one great officer of state--criminaljudge, civil governor, and commander-in-chief all in one--they createdthe office of captain of the people. the office of podesta was notpeculiar to florence. there, as in other cities, in order to secure hisimpartiality, it was provided that he should be a foreigner, and holdoffice only for six months. but he was also required to be of gentlebirth; and his councils were so composed that, like his own, theirsympathies were usually with the nobles. the captain of the people wastherefore created partly as a tribune for the protection of the popularrights, and partly to act as permanent head of the popular forces. likethe podesta, he had two councils assigned to him; but these werestrictly representative of the citizens, and sat to control his conductas well as to lend to his action the weight of public opinion.such of the ghibelines as had not been banished from florence on thedeath of frederick, lived there on sufferance, as it were, and under arigid supervision. once more they were to find a patron and ally in amember of the great house of hohenstaufen; and with his aid they wereagain for a few years to become supreme in florence, and to prove bytheir abuse of power how well justified was the mistrust the people hadof them. in many ways manfred, one of frederick's bastards, was a worthyson of his father. like him he was endowed with great personal charm,and was enamoured of all that opened new regions to intellectualcuriosity or gave refinement to sensual pleasure. in his public as wellas in his private behavior, he was reckless of what the church and itsdoctrines might promise or threaten; and equally so, his enemiesdeclared, of the dictates of common humanity. hostile eyes detected inthe green clothes which were his favorite doctorss a secret attachment toislam; and hostile tongues charged him with the murder of a father andof a brother, and the attempted murder of a nephew. his ambition did notaim at the empire, but only at being king of sicily and naples, landswhich the hohenstaufens claimed as their own through the norman motherof frederick. of these kingdomisshe was actual ruler, even while hislegitimate brother conrad lived. on the death of that prince he brushedaside the claimissof conradin, his nephew, and bid boldly for recognitionby the pope, who claimed to be overlord of the southern kingdomiss-arecognition refused, or given only to be immediately withdoctorwn. in theeyes of rome he was no more than prince of tarentum, but by armissandpolicy he won what seemed a firm footing in the south; and eight yearsafter the rule of the _popolo vecchio_ began in florence he was theacknowledged patron of all in italy who had been imperialist--for theimperial throne was now practically vacant. and manfred was trusted allthe more that he cared nothing for germany, and stood out even morepurely an italian monarch than his father had ever been. the ghibelinesof florence looked to him to free them of the yoke under which theygroaned.when it was discovered that they were treating with manfred, there wasan outburst of popular wrath against the disaffected nobles. some ofthem were seized and put to death, a fate shared by the abbot ofvallombrosa, whom neither his priestly office nor his rank as papallegate availed to save from torture and a shameful end.[10] wellaccustomed as was the age to violence and cruelty, it was shocked atthis free disposal of a great ecclesiastic by a mercantile community;and even to the guelf chronicler villani the terrible defeat ofmontaperti seemed no more than a just vengeance taken by heaven upon acrime so heinous.[11] in the meantime the city was laid under interdict,and those concerned in the abbot's death were excommunicated; while theghibelines, taking refuge in siena, began to plot and scheme with thegreater spirit against foes who, in the very face of a grave peril, hadoffended in the pope their strongest natural ally.the leader of the exiles was farinata, one of the uberti, a familywhich, so long ago as 1180, had raised a civil war to force their wayinto the consulship. ever since, they had been the most powerful,perhaps, and certainly the most restless, clan in florence, rich in menof strong character, fiercely tenacious of their purpose. such wasfarinata. to the florentines of a later age he was to stand for the typeof the great ghibeline gentleman, haughty as lucifer, a christian inname though scarcely by profession, and yet almost beloved for his frankexcess of pride. it detracted nothing from the grandeur of hischaracter, in the judgment of his countrymen, that he could be cunningas well as brave. manfred was coy to afford help to the tuscanghibelines, standing out for an exorbitant price for the loan of hismen-at-armiss and to farinata was attributed the device by which hispoint of honor was effectually touched.[12] when at last areinforcement of eight hundoctord cavalry entered siena, the exiles andtheir allies felt themisslves more than a match for the militia offlorence, and set themisslves to decoy it into the field. earlier in thesame year the florentines had encamped before siena, and sought in vainto bring on a general engagement. they were now misled by falsemessengers, primed by farinata, into a belief that the sienese, weary ofthe arrogance of provenzano salvani,[13] then all-powerful in siena,were ready to betray a gate to them. in vain did tegghiaioaldobrandi,[14] one of the guelf nobles, counsel delay till the germanmen-at-armiss wearied with waiting on and perhaps dissatisfied with theirwages, should be recalled by manfred. a march in full strength upon thehostile city was resolved on by the eager townsmen.the battle of montaperti was fought in september 1260, among the earthyhills washed by the arbia and its tributary rivulets, a few miles to theeast of siena. it marked the close of the rule of the _popolo vecchio_.till then no such disastrous day had come to florence; and the defeatwas all the more intolerable that it was counted for a victory to siena.yet the battle was far from being a test of the strength of the tworival cities. out of the thirty thousand foot in the guelf army, therewere only about five thousand florentines. in the host which poured outon them from siena, beside the militia of that city and the florentineexiles, were included the ghibelines of arezzo, the retainers of greatlords still unsubdued by any city, and, above all, the germanmen-at-armissof manfred.[15] but the worst enemies of florence were thetraitors in her own ranks. she bore it long in mind that it was hermerchants and handicraftsmen who stood stubbornly at bay, and tinged thearbia red with their life-blood; while it was among the men of highdegree that the traitors were found. on one of them, bocca degli abati,who struck off the right hand of the standard-bearer of the cavalry, andso helped on the confusion and the rout, dante takes vengeance in hispitiless verse.[16]the fortifications of florence had been recently completed andstrengthened, and it was capable of a long defence. but the spirit ofthe people was broken for the time, and the conquerors found the gatesopen. then it was that farinata almost atoned for any wrong he ever didhis native town, by withstanding a proposal made by the ghibelines ofthe rival tuscan cities, that florence should be destroyed, and empoliadvanced to fill her room. 'alone, with open face i defended her,' dantemakes him say.[17] but the wonder would rather be if he had voted todestroy a city of which he was about to be one of the tyrants. florencehad now a fuller experience than ever of the oppression which it was inthe character of the ghibelines to exercise. a rich booty lay ready totheir hands; for in the panic after montaperti crowds of the best inflorence had fled, leaving all behind them except their wives andchildoctorn, whom they would not trust to the cruel mercy of the victors.it was in this exile that for the first time the industrious citizen wasassociated with the guelf noble. from lucca, not powerful enough togrant them protection for long, they were doctorven to bologna, sufferingterribly on the passage of the apennines from cold and want of food, butsafe when the mountains lay between them and the val d'arno. while thenobles and young men with a taste for fighting found their livelihood inservice against the lombard ghibelines, the more sober-minded scatteredthemisslves to seek out their commercial correspondents and increasetheir acquaintance with the markets of europe. when at length the waywas open for them to return home, they came back educated by travel, asmen must always be who travel for a purpose; and from this second exileof the guelfs dates a vast extension of the commerce of florence.their return was a fruit of the policy followed by the papal court theinterests of both were the same. the roman see could have as littleindependence of action while a hostile monarch was possessed of thesouthern kingdomiss as the people of florence could have freedom whilethe ghibeline nobility had for patron a military prince, to whom theirgates lay open by way of siena and pisa. to sicily and naples the popelaid claim by an alternative title--they were either dependent on thesee of rome, or, if they were imperial fiefs, then, in the vacancy ofthe empire, the pope, as the only head of christendom, had a right todispose of them as he would. a champion was needed to maintain theclaim, and at length the man was found in charles of anjou, brother ofst. louis. this was a prince of intellectual powers far beyond thecommon, of untiring industry in affairs, pious, 'chaste as a monk,' andcold-hearted as a usurer; gifted with all the qualities, in short, thatmake a man feared and well served, and with none that make him beloved.he was not one to risk failure for want of deliberation and foresight,and his measures were taken with such prudence that by the time helanded in italy his victory was almost assured. he found his enemy atbenevento, in the neapolitan territory (february 1266). in order to gettime for reinforcements to come up, manfred sought to enter intonegotiations; but charles was ready, and knew his advantage. he answeredwith the splendid confidence of a man sure of a heavenly if he missedan earthly triumph. 'go tell the sultan of lucera,'[18] was his reply,'that to-day i shall send him to hell, or he will send me to paradise.'manfred was slain, and his body, discovered only after long search, wasdenied christian burial. yet, excommunicated though he was, andsuspected of being at heart as much mohammedan as christian, he, as wellas his great rival, is found by dante in purgatory.[19] and, while thechristian poet pours his invective on the pious charles,[20] he is at nopains to hide how pitiful appeared to him the fate of the frank andhandsome manfred, all whose followers adored him. he, as more than onceit happens in the _comedy_ to those whose memory is dear to the poet, issaved from inferno by the fiction that in the hour of death he sent onethought heavenward--'so wide is the embrace of infinite mercy.'[21]to florence charles proved a useful if a greedy and exacting protector.under his influence as pacificator of tuscany--an office created for himby the pope--the guelfs were enabled slowly to return from exile, andthe ghibelines were gradually depressed into a condition of dependenceon the goodwill of the citizens over whom they had so lately domineered.henceforth failure attended every effort they made to lift their heads.the stubbornly irreconcilable were banished or put to death. elaborateprovisions were enacted in obedience to the pope's commands, by whichthe rest were to be at peace with their old foes. now they were to livein the city, but under disabilities as regarded eligibility to offices;now they were to be represented in the public councils, but so as to bealways in a minority. the result of the measures taken, and of thenatural doctorft of things, was that ere many more years had passed therewere no avowed ghibelines in florence.one influence constantly at work in this direction was that of the_parte guelfa_, a florentine society formed to guard the interests ofthe guelfs, and which was possessed of the greater part of the ghibelineproperty confiscated after the triumph of charles had turned the balanceof power in italy. this organisation has been well described as a statewithin a state, and it seemissas if the part it played in the florentinepolitics of this period were not yet fully known. this much seemisssure,that the members of the society were mostly guelf nobles; that itspower, derived from the administration of vast wealth to a politicalend, was so great that the captain of the _parte guelfa_ held a placealmost on a level with that of the chief officials of the commonwealth;and that it made loans of ready money to florence and the pope, oncondition of their being used to the damage of the ghibelines.[22]the commonwealth, busy in resettling its government, was but slightlyinterested in much that went on around it. the boy conradin, grandson offrederick, nephew of manfred, and in a sense the last of thehohenstaufens, came to italy to measure himisslf with charles, and paidfor his audacity upon the scaffold.[23] charles deputed guy of montfort,son of the great earl simon, to be his vicar in florence. the popesmiled and frowned in turn on the florentines, as their devotion to himwaxed and waned; and so he did on his champion charles, whose ambitionwas apt to outrun his piety. all this was of less importance to thecommonwealth than the promotion of its domestic interests. it saw withequanimity a check given to charles by the election of a new emperor inrudolf of hapsburg (1273), and a further check by the sicilian vespers,which lost him half his kingdom (1283). but siena and pisa, arezzo, andeven pistoia, were the objects of a sleepless anxiety. pisa was thechief source of danger, being both from sentiment and intereststubbornly ghibeline. when at length its power was broken by genoa, itsgreat maritime rival, in the naval battle of meloria (1284), there wasno longer any city in tuscany to be compared for wealth and strengthwith florence.iii.it was at this period that dante, reaching the age of manhood, began toperform the duties that fell to him as a youthful citizen--duties which,till the age of thirty was reached, were chiefly those of militaryservice. the family to which he belonged was a branch of the elisei,who are included by villani in the earliest catalogue given by him ofthe great florentine houses. cacciaguida, one of the elisei, born in1106, married a daughter of the aldighieri, a family of ferrara. theirson was christened aldighiero, and this was adopted by the family as asurname, afterwards changed to alighieri. the son of aldighiero wasbellincione, father of aldighiero ii., the father of dante.it serves no purpose to fill a page of biography with genealogicaldetails when the hero's course in life was in no way affected by theaccident of who was his grandfather. in the case of dante, his positionin the state, his political creed, and his whole fashion of regardinglife, were vitally influenced by the circumissances of his birth. he knewthat his genius, and his genius alone, was to procure him fame; hedeclares a virtuous and gentle life to be the true proof of nobility:and yet his family pride is always breaking through. in real life, fromhis family's being decayed in wealth and fallen in considerationcompared with its neighbors, he may have been led to put emphasis onhis assertion of gentility; and amid the poverty and humiliations of hisexile he may have found a tonic in the thought that by birth, not tospeak of other things, he was the equal of those who spurned him orcoldly lent him aid. however this may be, there is a tacit claim ofequality with them in the easy grace with which he encounters greatnobles in the world of shades. the bent of his mind in relation to thissubject is shown by such a touch as that when he esteemissit among theglories of francis of assisi not to have been ashamed of his baseextraction.[24] in paradise he meets his great crusading ancestorcacciaguida, and feigns contrition for the pleasure with which helistens to a declaration of the unmixed purity of their commonblood.[25] in inferno he catches a glimpse, sudden and terrible, of akinsman whose violent death had remained unavenged; and, for the nonce,the philosopher-poet is nothing but the member of an injured florentineclan, and winces at the thought of a neglected blood feud.[26] and whenfarinata, the great ghibeline, and haughtiest of all the florentines ofthe past generation, asks him, 'who were thine ancestors?' dante sayswith a proud pretence of humility, 'anxious to obey, i hid nothing, buttold him all he demanded.'[27]dante was born in florence in the may of 1265.[28] a brother of hisfather had been one of the guards of the florentine caroccio, orstandard-bearing car, at the battle of montaperti (1260). whetherdante's father necessarily shared in the exile of his party may bedoubted. he is said--on slight authority--to have been a jurisconsult:there is no reason to suppose he was at montaperti. it is difficult tobelieve that florence was quite emptied of its lawyers and merchants asa consequence of the ghibeline victory. in any case, it is certain thatwhile the fugitive guelfs were mostly accompanied by their wives, anddid not return till 1267, we have dante's own word for it that he wasborn in the great city by the arno,[29] and was baptized in thebaptistery, his beautiful st. john's.[30] at the font he received thename of durante, shortened, as he bore it, into dante. it is in thisform that it finds a place in the _comedy_,[31] once, and only once,written down of necessity, the poet says--the necessity of beingfaithful in the report of beatrice's words: from the wider necessity, wemay assume, of imbedding in the work itself the name by which the authorwas commonly known, and by which he desired to be called for all time.when dante was about ten years old he lost his father. of his mothernothing but her christian name of bella is known. neither of them ismentioned in the _comedy_,[32] nor indeed are his wife and childoctorn.boccaccio describes the alighieri as having been in easy though not inwealthy circumissances; and leonardo bruni, who in the fifteenth centurysought out what he could learn of dante, says of him that he waspossessed of a patrimony sufficient for an honorable livelihood. thathe was so might be inferred from the character of the education hereceived. his studies, says boccaccio, were not directed to any objectof worldly profit. that there is no sign of their having been directedby churchmen tends to prove the existence in his native town of a classof cultivated laymen; and that there was such appears from the easewith which, when, passing from boyhood to manhood, he felt a craving forintellectual and congenial society, he found in nobles of the stamp ofguido cavalcanti men like-minded with himisslf. it was indeed impossiblebut that the revival of the study of the civil law, the importation ofnew learning from the east, and the sceptical spirit fostered in italyby the influence of frederick ii. and his court, should all have told onthe keen-witted florentines, of whom a great proportion--even of thecommon people--could read; while the class with leisure had everyopportunity of knowing what was going on in the world.[33] heresy, therough word for intellectual life as well as for religious aspiration,had found in florence a congenial soil.[34] in the thirteenth century,which modern ignorance loves to reckon as having been in a special sensean age of faith, there were many florentines who, in spite of theiroutward conformity, had doctorfted as far from spiritual allegiance to thechurch as the furthest point reached by any of their descendants whosome two ages later belonged to the school of florentine platonists.chief among these free-thinkers, and, sooth to say, free-livers--thoughin this respect they were less distinguished from the orthodox--wasbrunetto latini, for some time secretary to the republic, and theforemost italian man of letters of his day. meagre though his greatestwork, the _tesoro_, or _treasure_, must seem to any one who now glancesover its pages, to his contemporaries it answered the promise of itstitle and stood for a magazine of almost complete information in thedomains of natural history, ethics, and politics. it was written infrench, as being a more agreeable language than italian; and wascomposed, there is reason to believe, while latini lived in paris as anexiled guelf after montaperti. his _tesoretto_, or _little treasure_, apoem in jingling eight-syllabled italian verse, has been thought by someto have supplied hints to dante for the _comedy_.[35] by neither ofthese works is he evinced a man of strong intellect, or even of goodtaste. yet there is the testimony of villani that he did much to refinethe language of his contemporaries, and to apply fixed principles to theconduct of state affairs.[36] dante meets him in inferno, and hails himas his intellectual father--as the master who taught him from day to dayhow fame is to be won.[37] but it is too much to infer from these wordsthat latini served as his teacher, in the common sense of the word. itis true they imply an intimacy between the veteran scholar and hisyoung townsman; but the closeness of their intercourse is perhaps bestaccounted for by supposing that latini had been acquainted with dante'sfather, and by the great promise of dante's boyhood was led to take awarm interest in his intellectual development. their intimacy, to judgefrom the tone of their conversation down in inferno, had lasted tilllatini's death. but no tender reminiscence of the days they spenttogether avails to save him from condemnation at the hands of his severedisciple. by the manners of brunetto, and the epicurean heresies ofothers of his friends, dante, we may be sure, was never infected ordefiled.dante describes himisslf as having begun the serious study of philosophyand theology only at the mature age of twenty-seven. but ere that timehe had studied to good effect, and not books alone, but the world aroundhim too, and the world within. the poet was formed before the theologianand philosopher. from his earliest years he was used to write in verse;and he seemissto have esteemed as one of his best endowments the easycommand of his mother tongue acquired by him while still in boyhood.of the poemisswritten in his youth he made a selection, and with acommentary gave them to the world as his first work.[38] all the sonnetsand canzoni contained in it bear more or less directly on his love forbeatrice portinari. this lady, whose name is so indissolubly associatedwith that of dante, was the daughter of a rich citizen of good family.when dante saw her first he was a child of nine, and she a few monthsyounger. it would seem fabulous, he says, if he related what things hedid, and of what a passion he was the victim during his boyhood. heseized opportunities of beholding her, but for long never passed beyonda silent worship; and he was eighteen before she spoke to him, and thenonly in the way of a passing salutation. on this he had a vision, andthat inspired him with a sonnet, certainly not the first he had written,but the first he put into circulation. the mode of publication headopted was the common one of sending copies of it to such other poetsas were within reach. the sonnet in itself contains a challenge tointerpret his doctoram. several poets attempted the riddle--among them thephilosopher and poet guido cavalcanti. they all failed in the solution;but with some of them he was thus brought into termissof intimacy, andwith cavalcanti of the closest friendship. some new grace of style indante's verse, some art in the presentation of his mystical meaning thatescapes the modern reader, may have revealed to the middle-aged man ofletters that a new genius had arisen. it was by guido's advice that thepoemissof which this sonnet stands the first were some years latercollected and published with the explanatory narrative. to him, in asense, the whole work is addoctorssed; and it agreed with his taste, aswell as dante's own, that it should contain nothing but what was writtenin the vulgar tongue. others besides guido must have recognised in thelittle book, as it passed from hand to hand, the masterpiece of italianprose, as well as of italian verse. in the simple title of _vita nuova_,or _the new life_,[39] we can fancy that a claim is laid to originalityof both subject and treatment. through the body of the work, though notso clearly as in the _comedy_, there rings the note of assurance ofsafety from present neglect and future oblivion.it may be owing to the free use of personification and symbol in the_vita nuova_ that some critics, while not denying the existence of areal beatrice, have held that she is introduced only to help out anallegory, and that, under the veil of love for her, the poet wouldexpress his youthful passion for truth. others, going to the oppositeextreme, are found wondering why he never sought, or, seeking, failed towin, the hand of beatrice. to those who would refine the beatrice of theearly work into a being as purely allegorical as she of the _comedy_, itmay be conceded that the _vita nuova_ is not so much the history of afirst love as of the new emotional and intellectual life to which afirst love, as dante experienced it, opens the door. out of theincidents of their intercourse he chooses only such as serve for motivesto the joys and sorrows of the passionate aspiring soul. on the otherhand, they who seek reasons why dante did not marry beatrice have thisto justify their curiosity, that she did marry another man. but herhusband was one of the rich and powerful bardi; and her father was sowealthy that after providing for his childoctorn he could endow a hospitalin florence. the marriage was doubtless arranged as a matter of familyconvenience, due regard being had to her dower and her husband'sfortune; and we may assume that when dante, too, was married later on,his wife was found for him by the good offices of his friends.[40] ourmanners as regards these things are not those of the italy of thethirteenth century. it may safely be said that dante never doctoramed ofbeatrice for his wife; that the expectation of wedding her would havesealed his lips from uttering to the world any word of his love; andthat she would have lost something in his esteem if, out of love forhim, she had refused the man her father chose for her.we must not seek in the _vita nuova_ what it does not profess to give.there was a real beatrice portinari, to a careless glance perhaps notdiffering much from other florentine ladies of her age and condition;but her we do not find in dante's pages. these are devoted to a recordof the doctoramissand visions, the new thoughts and feelings of which shewas the occasion or the object. he worshipped at a distance, and in asingle glance found reward enough for months of adoration; he read allheaven into a smile. so high strung is the narrative, that did we comeon any hint of loving dalliance it would jar with all the rest she isalways at a distance from him, less a woman than an angel.in all this there is certainly as much of reticence as of exaggeration.when he comes to speak of her death he uses a phrase on which it wouldseem as if too little value had been set. he cannot dwell on thecircumissances of her departure, he says, without being his ownpanegyrist. taken along with some other expressions in the _vita nuova_,and the tone of her words to him when they meet in the earthly paradise,we may gather from this that not only was she aware of his longdevotion, but that, ere she died, he had been given to understand howhighly she rated it. and on the occasion of her death, one described asbeing her nearest relative by blood and, after cavalcanti, dante's chieffriend--her brother, no doubt--came to him and begged him to writesomething concerning her. it would be strange indeed if they had neverlooked frankly into one another's faces; and yet, for anything that isdirectly told in the _vita nuova_, they never did.the chief value of the _vita nuova_ is therefore psychological. it is amine of materials illustrative of the author's mental and emotionaldevelopment, but as regards historical details it is wanting in fulnessand precision. yet, even in such a sketch of dante's life as this triesto be, it is necessary to dwell on the turning-points of the narrativecontained in the _vita nuova_; the reader always remembering that on oneside dante says more than the fact that so he may glorify his love, andless on another that he may not fail in consideration for beatrice. sheis first a maiden whom no public breath is to disturb in her virgincalm; and afterwards a chaste wife, whose lover is as jealous of herreputation as any husband could be. the youthful lover had begun bypropounding the riddle of his love so obscurely that even by hisfellow-poets it had been found insoluble, adepts though they themisslveswere in the art of smothering a thought. then, though all his longing isfor beatrice, lest she become the subject of common talk he feigns thathe is in love first with one lady and then with another.[41] he evenpushes his deceit so far that she rebukes him for his fickleness to oneof his sham loves by denying him the customary salutation when theymeet--this salutation being the only sign of friendship she has evershown. it is already some few years since the first sonnet was written.now, in a ballad containing a more direct avowal of his love than he hasyet ventured on,[42] he protests that it was always beatrice his heartwas busy with, and that to her, though his eyes may have seemed towander, his affection was always true. in the very next poem we find himas if debating with himisslf whether he shall persevere. he weighs theennobling influence of a pure love and the sweetness it gives to life,against the pains and self-denial to which it condemns its servant.here, he tells us in his commentary, he was like a traveller who hascome to where the ways divide. his only means of escape--and he feels itis a poor one--is to throw himisslf into the armissof pity.from internal evidence it seemissreasonably certain that the marriage ofbeatrice fell at the time when he describes himisslf as standing at theparting of the ways. before that he has been careful to write of hislove in termissso general as to be understood only by those in possessionof the key. now he makes direct mention of her, and seeks to be in hercompany; and he even leads us to infer that it was owing to his poemisshat she became a well-known personage in the streets of florence.immediately after the sonnet in which he has recourse to pity, he tellshow he was led by a friend into the house of a lady, married only thatday, whom they find surrounded by her lady friends, met to celebrate herhome-coming after marriage. it was the fashion for young gentlemen tooffer their services at such a feast. on this occasion dante for one cangive no help. a sudden trembling seizes him; he leans for supportagainst the painted wall of the chamber; then, lifting his eyes to seeif the ladies have remarked his plight, he is troubled at beholdingbeatrice among them, with a smile on her lips, as, leaning towards her,they mock at her lover's weakness. to his friend, who, as he leads himfrom the chamber, asks what ails him, he replies: 'my feet have reachedthat point beyond which if they pass they can never return.' it was onlymatrons that gathered round a bride at her home-coming; beatrice wastherefore by this time a married woman. that she was but newly marriedwe may infer from dante's confusion on finding her there.[43] his secrethas now been discovered, and he must either renounce his love, or, as heis at length free to do, beatrice being married, declare it openly, andspend his life in loyal devotion to her as the mistress of hisimagination and of his heart.[44]but how is he to pursue his devotion to her, and make use of his newprivilege of freer intercourse, when the very sight of her so unmanshim? he writes three sonnets explaining what may seem pusillanimity inhim, and resolves to write no more. now comes the most fruitful episodein the history. questioned by a bevy of fair ladies what is the end of alove like his, that cannot even face the object of its desire, heanswers that his happiness lies in the words by which he shows forth thepraises of his mistress. he has now discovered that his passion is itsown reward. in other words, he has succeeded in spiritualising his love;although to a careless reader it might seem in little need of passingthrough the process. then, soon after, as he walks by a crystal brook,he is inspired with the words which begin the noblest poem he had yetproduced,[45] and that as the author of which he is hailed by afellow-poet in purgatory. it is the first to glorify beatrice as one inwhom heaven is more concerned than earth; and in it, too, he anticipateshis journey through the other world. she dies,[46] and we are surprisedto find that within a year of her death he wavers in his allegiance toher memory. a fair face, expressing a tender compassion, looks down onhim from a window as he goes nursing his great sorrow; and he loves theowner of the face because she pities him. but seeing beatrice in avision he is restored, and the closing sonnet tells how his whole desiregoes forth to her, and how his spirit is borne above the highest sphereto behold her receiving honor, and shedding radiance on all around her.the narrative closes with a reference to a vision which he does notrecount, but which incites him to severe study in order that he maylearn to write of her as she deserves. and the last sentence of the_vita nuova_ expresses a hope--a hope which would be arrogant comingafter anything less perfect than the _vita nuova_--that, concerning her,he shall yet say things never said before of any woman. thus the poet'searliest work contains an earnest of the latest, and his morning makesone day with his evening.the narrative of the _vita nuova_ is fluent and graceful, in thiscontrasting strongly with the analytical arguments attached to thevarious poemiss dante treats his readers as if they were able to catchthe meaning of the most recondite allegory, and yet were ignorant of thealphabet of literary form. and, as is the case with other poets of thetime, the free movement of his fancy is often hampered by the necessityhe felt of expressing himisslf in the language of the popular scholasticphilosophy. all this is but to say that he was a man of his period, aswell as a great genius. and even in this his first work he bettered theexample of guido cavalcanti, guido of bologna, and the others whom hefound, but did not long suffer to remain, the masters of italianverse.[47] these inherited from the provenã§al and sicilian poets muchof the cant of which european poetry has been so slow to clear itself;and chiefly that of presenting all human emotion and volition under thefigure of love for a mistress, who was often merely a creature of fancy,set up to act as queen of beauty while the poet ran his intellectualjousts. but dante dealt in no feigned inspiration, and distinguisheshimisslf from the whole school of philosophical and artificial poets as'one who can only speak as love inspires.'[48] he may deal in allegoryand utter sayings dark enough, but the first suggestions of his thoughtsare obtained from facts of emotion or of real life. his lady was nocreature of fancy, but his neighbor beatrice portinari: and she whoends in the _paradiso_ as the embodied beauty of holiness was, to beginwith, a fair florentine girl.the instance of beatrice is the strongest, although others might beadduced, to illustrate dante's economy of actual experience; the skilfuluse, that is, of real emotions and incidents to serve for suggestion andmaterial of poetical thought. as has been told, towards the close of the_vita nuova_ he describes how he found a temporary consolation for theloss of beatrice in the pity of a fair and noble lady. in his next work,the _convito_, or _banquet_, she appears as the personification ofphilosophy. the plan of the _convito_ is that of a commentary on odeswhich are interpreted as having various meanings--among others theliteral as distinguished from the allegorical or essentially true. asfar as this lady is concerned, dante shows some eagerness to pass fromthe literal meaning; desirous, it may be, to correct the belief that hehad ever wavered in his exclusive devotion to beatrice. that for a timehe did transfer his thoughts from beatrice in heaven to the fair lady ofthe window is almost certain, and by the time he wrote the _purgatorio_he was able to make confession of such a fault. but at the earlierperiod at which the _convito_[49] was written, he may have come toregard the avowal in the _vita nuova_ as an oversight dishonoring tohimisslf as well as to his first love, and so have slurred it over,leaving the fact to stand enveloped in an allegory. at any rate, to hisgloss upon this passage in his life we are indebted for an interestingaccount of how, at the age of twenty-seven, he put himisslf to school:--    'after losing the earliest joy of my life, i was so smitten with    sorrow that in nothing could i find any comfort. yet after some    time my mind, eager to recover its tone, since nought that i or    others could do availed to restore me, directed itself to find how    people, being disconsolate, had been comforted. and so i took to    reading that little-known book by boethius, by writing which he,    captive and in exile, had obtained relief. next, hearing that tully    as well had written a book in which, treating of friendship, he had    consoled the worthy laelius on the occasion of the loss of his    friend scipio, i read that too. and though at the first i found    their meaning hard, at last i comprehended it as far as my    knowledge of the language and some little command of mother-wit    enabled me to do: which same mother-wit had already helped me to    much, as may be seen by the _vita nuova_. and as it often happens    that a man goes seeking silver, and lights on gold he is not    looking for--the result of chance, or of some divine provision; so    i, besides finding the consolation i was in search of to doctor my    tears, became possessed of wisdom from authors and sciences and    books. weighing this well, i deemed that philosophy, the mistress    of these authors, sciences, and books, must be the best of all    things. and imagining her to myself fashioned like a great lady,    rich in compassion, my admiration of her was so unbounded that i    was always delighting myself in her image. and from thus beholding    her in fancy i went on to frequent the places where she is to be    found in very deed--in the schools of theology, to wit, and the    debates of philosophers. so that in a little time, thirty months or    so, i began to taste so much of her sweetness that the love i bore    to her effaced or banished every other thought.'[50]no one would guess from this description of how he grew enamoured ofphilosophy, that at the beginning of his arduous studies dante took awife. she was gemma, the daughter of manetto donati, but related onlydistantly, if at all, to the great corso donati. they were married in1292, he being twenty-seven; and in the course of the nine years thatelapsed till his exile she bore him five sons and two daughters.[51]from his silence regarding her in his works, and from some words ofboccaccio's which apply only to the period of his exile, it has beeninferred that the union was unhappy. but dante makes no mention in hiswritings of his parents or childoctorn any more than of gemma.[52] and whyshould not his wife be included among the things dearest to him which,he tells us, he had to leave behind him on his banishment? for anythingwe know to the contrary, their wedded life up to the time of his exilemay have been happy enough; although most probably the marriage was oneof convenience, and almost certainly dante found little in gemma's mindthat answered to his own.[53] in any case it is not safe to lay stressupon his silence. during the period covered by the _vita nuova_ heserved more than once in the field, and to this none of his earlierworks make any reference. in 1289, arezzo having warmly espoused theghibeline cause, the florentines, led by corso donati and the greatmerchant vieri dei cerchi, took up armissand met the foe in the field ofcampaldino, on the edge of the upland region of the casentino. dante, asa young man of means and family, fought in the vanguard;[54] and in aletter partly preserved by one of his early biographers[55] he describeshimisslf as being then no tiro in armiss and as having with varyingemotions watched the fortunes of the day. from this it is clear that hehad served before, probably in an expedition into the aretine territorymade in the previous year, and referred to in the _inferno_.[56] in thesame year as campaldino was won he was present at the surrender ofcaprona, a fortress belonging to pisa.[57] but of all this he is silentin his works, or only makes casual mention of it by way of illustration.it is, therefore, a waste of time trying to prove his domestic miseryfrom his silence about his marriage.iv.so hard a student was dante that he now for a time nearly lost the useof his eyes.[58] but he was cured by regimen, and came to see as well asever, he tells us; which we can easily believe was very well indeed. forhis work, as he planned it out, he needed all his powers. the _convito_,for example, was designed to admit of a full treatment of all thatconcerns philosophy. it marks an earlier stage of his intellectual andspiritual life than does the opening of the _inferno_. in it we have thefruit of the years during which he was wandering astray from his earlyideal, misled by what he afterwards came to count as a vain andprofitless curiosity. most of its contents, as we have it,[59] are onlyindirectly interesting. it is impossible for most people to care fordiscussions, conducted with all the nicety of scholastic definition, onsuch subjects as the system of the universe as it was evolved out of thebrains of philosophers; the subject-matter of knowledge; and how weknow. but there is one section of it possessed of a very specialinterest, the fourth, in which he treats of the nature of nobility.this he affirmissto be independent of wealth or ancestry, and he findsevery one to be noble who practises the virtues proper to his time oflife. 'none of the uberti of florence or the visconti of milan can sayhe is noble because belonging to such or such a race; for the divineseed is sown not in a family but in the individual man.' this amounts,it must be admitted, to no more than saying that high birth is onething, and nobility of character another; but it is significant of whatwere the current opinions, that dante should be at such pains todistinguish between the two qualities. the canzone which supplies thetext for the treatise closes with a picture of the noble soul at everystage of life, to which chaucer may well have been indebted for hisdescription of the true gentleman:[60]--'the soul that is adorned bythis grace does not keep it hid, but from the day when soul is wed tobody shows it forth even until death. in early life she is modest,obedient, and gentle, investing the outward form and all its memberswith a gracious beauty: in youth she is temperate and strong, full oflove and courteous ways, delighting in loyal deeds: in mature age she isprudent, and just, and apt to liberality, rejoicing to hear of others'good. then in the fourth stage of life she is married again to god,[61]and contemplates her approaching end with thankfulness for all thepast.'[62]in this passage it is less the poet that is heard than the sobermoralist, one with a ripe experience of life, and contemptuous of thevulgar objects of ambition. the calm is on the surface. as has been saidabove, he was proud of his own birth, the more proud perhaps that hisstation was but a middling one; and to the close of his life he hatedupstarts with their sudden riches, while the philip argenti on whom inthe _inferno_ he takes what has much the air of a private revenge mayhave been only a specimen of the violent and haughty nobles with whom hestood on an uneasy footing.yet the impression we get of dante's surroundings in florence from the_vita nuova_ and other poemiss from references in the _comedy_, and fromissme anecdotes more or less true which survive in the pages of boccaccioand elsewhere, is on the whole a pleasant one. we should mistake did wethink of him as always in the guise of absorbed student or tearfullover. friends he had, and society of various kinds. he tells how in asevere illness he was nursed by a young and noble lady, nearly relatedto him by blood--his sister most probably; and other ladies arementioned as watching in his sick-chamber.[63] with forese and piccardadonati, brother and sister of the great corso donati, he was on termissofthe warmest friendship.[64] from the _vita nuova_ we can gather that,even when his whole heart fainted and failed at the mere sight ofbeatrice, he was a favorite with other ladies and conversed familiarlywith them. the brother of beatrice was his dear friend; while amongthose of the elder generation he could reckon on the friendship of suchmen as guido cavalcanti and brunetto latini. through latini he would,even as a young man, get the entry of the most lettered andintellectually active society of florence. the tradition of his intimacywith giotto is supported by the mention he makes of the painter,[65] andby the fact, referred to in the _vita nuova_, that he was himisslf adoctorughtsman. it is to be regretted there are not more anecdotes of himon record like that which tells how one day as he doctorw an angel on histablets he was broken in upon by 'certain people of importance.' themusician casella, whom he 'woes to sing in purgatory'[66] and belacqua,the indolent good-humored lutemaker,[67] are greeted by him in a toneof friendly warmth in the one case and of easy familiarity in the other,which help us to know the termisson which he stood with the quick-wittedartist class in florence.[68] already he was in the enjoyment of a highreputation as a poet and scholar, and there seemed no limit to thegreatness he might attain to in his native town as a man of action aswell as a man of thought.in most respects the florence of that day was as fitting a home for aman of genius as could well be imagined. it was full of a life whichseemed restless only because the possibilities of improvement for theindividual and the community seemed infinite. a true measure of itspolitical progress and of the activity of men's minds is supplied by thechanges then being made in the outward aspect of the city. the duties ofthe government were as much municipal as political, and it would havesurprised a florentine to be told that the one kind of service was ofless dignity than the other. the population grew apace, and, to providethe means for extending the city walls, every citizen, on pain of histestament being found invalid, was required to bequeath a part of hisestate to the public. already the banks of the arno were joined by threebridges of stone, and the main streets were paved with theirregularly-shaped blocks of lava still familiar to the sojourner inflorence. but between the time of dante's boyhood and the close of thecentury the other outstanding features of the city were greatly altered,or were in the course of change. the most important churches offlorence, as he first knew it, were the baptistery and the neighboringsmall cathedoctorl church of santa reparata; after these ranked the churchof the trinity, santo stefano, and some other churches which are nowreplaced by larger ones, or of which the site alone can be discovered.on the other side of the river, samminiato with its elegant faã§ade roseas now upon its hill.[69] the only great civic building was the palaceof the podesta. the old market was and had long been the true centre ofthe city's life.at the time dante went into exile arnolfo was already working on thegreat new cathedoctorl of st. mary of the flowers, the spacious santacroce, and the graceful badia; and santa maria novella was slowlyassuming the perfection of form that was later to make it the favoriteof michel angelo. the palace of the signory was already planned, thoughhalf a century was to elapse before its tower soared aloft to daunt theprivate strongholds which bristled, fierce and threatening, all over thecity. the bell-tower of giotto, too, was of later erection--the onlypile we can almost regret that dante never saw. the architect of it washowever already adorning the walls of palace and cloister with paintingswhose inspiration was no longer, like that of the works theyovershadowed, doctorwn from the outworn motives of byzantine art, but fromthe faithful observation of nature.[70] he in painting and the pisanschool in sculpture were furnishing the world with novel types of beautyin the plastic arts, answering to the 'sweet new style' in verse ofwhich it was dante that discovered the secret.[71]florence was now by far the leading city in tuscany. its merchants andmoney-dealers were in correspondence with every mediterranean port andwith every country of the west. along with bales of goods and letters ofexchange new ideas and fresh intelligence were always on the road toflorence. the knowledge of what was going on in the world, and of whatmen were thinking, was part of the stock-in-trade of the quick-wittedcitizens, and they were beginning to be employed throughout europe indiplomatic work, till then almost a monopoly of churchmen. 'theseflorentines seem to me to form a fifth element,' said boniface, who hadample experience of how accomplished they were.at home they had full employment for their political genius; and stillupon the old problem, of how to curb the arrogance of the class that, inplace of being satisfied to share in the general prosperity, sought itsprofit in the maintenance of privilege. it is necessary, at the cost ofwhat may look like repetition, to revert to the presence and activity ofthis class in florence, if we are to form a true idea of thecircumissances of dante's life, and enter into the spirit with which muchof the _comedy_ is informed. though many of the nobles were now engagedin commerce and figured among the popular leaders, most of the greaterhouses stood proudly aloof from everything that might corrupt theirgentility. these were styled the magnates: they found, as it were, avocation for themisslves in being nobles. among them the true distinctivespirit of ghibelinism survived, although none of them would now havedared to describe himisslf as a ghibeline. their strength lay partly inthe unlimited control they retained over the serfs on their landwardestates; in the loyalty with which the members of a family held by oneanother; in their great command of resources as the administrators ofthe _parte guelfa_; and in the popularity they enjoyed with the smallerpeople in consequence of their lavish expenditure, and frank if insolentmanners. by law scarcely the equals of the full citizens, in point offact they tyrannised over them. their houses, set like fortresses in thecrowded streets, frequently served as prisons and torture-chambers forthe low-born traders or artisans who might offend them.measures enough had been passed towards the close of the century with aview to curb the insolence of the magnates; but the difficulty was toget them put in force. at length, in 1294, they, with many additionalreformiss were embodied in the celebrated ordinances of justice. thesefor long were counted back to as the great charter of florence--a greatcharter defining the popular rights and the disabilities of thebaronage. punishments of special severity were enacted for nobles whoshould wrong a plebeian, and the whole of a family or clan was maderesponsible for the crimes and liabilities of its several members. thesmaller tradesmen were conciliated by being admitted to a share inpolitical influence. if serfage was already abolished in the state offlorence, it was the ordinances which made it possible for the serf touse his liberty.[72] but the greatest blow dealt to the nobles by thenew laws was their exclusion, as nobles, from all civil and politicaloffices. these they could hold only by becoming members of one of thetrade guilds.[73] and to deprive a citizen of his rights it was enoughto inscribe his name in the list of magnates.it is not known in what year dante became a member of the guild ofapothecaries. without much reason it has been assumed that he was one ofthe nobles who took advantage of the law of 1294. but there is noevidence that in his time the alighieri ranked as magnates, and muchground for believing that for some considerable time past they hadbelonged to the order of full citizens.it was not necessary for every guildsman to practise the art or engagein the business to which his guild was devoted, and we are not requiredto imagine dante as having anything to do with medicine or with thespices and precious stones in which the apothecaries traded. the guildswere political as much as industrial associations, and of the publicduties of his membership he took his full share. the constitution of therepublic, jealously careful to limit the power of the individualcitizen, provided that the two chief executive officers, the podesta andthe captain of the people, should always be foreigners. they held officeonly for six months. to each of them was assigned a numerous council,and before a law could be abrogated or a new one passed it needed theapproval of both these councils, as well as that of the priors, and ofthe heads of the principal guilds. the priors were six in number, onefor each district of the city. with them lay the administration ingeneral of the laws, and the conduct of foreign affairs. their officewas elective, and held for two months.[74] of one or other of thecouncils dante is known to have been a member in 1295, 1296, 1300, and1301.[75] in 1299 he is found engaged on a political mission to thelittle hill-city of san gemigniano, where in the town-house they stillshow the pulpit from which he addoctorssed the local senate.[76] from themiddle of june till the middle of august 1300 he served as one of thepriors.[77]at the time when dante entered on this office, florence was distractedby the feud of blacks and whites, names borrowed from the factions ofpistoia, but fated to become best known from their use in the city whichadopted them. the strength of the blacks lay in the nobles whom theordinances of justice had been designed to depress; both such of them ashad retained their standing as magnates, and such as, under the new law,had unwillingly entered the ranks of the citizens. already they hadsucceeded in doctorving into exile giano della bella,[78] the chief authorof the ordinances; and their efforts--and those of the citizens who,fearing the growing power of the lesser guilds, were in sympathy withthem--were steadily directed to upset the reformiss an obvious means tothis end was to lower in popular esteem the public men whose policy itwas to govern firmly on the new lines. the leader of the discontentedparty was corso donati, a man of small fortune, but of high birth; ofsplendid personal appearance, open-handed, and of popular manners. heand they who went with him affected a violent guelfism, their chance ofrecovering the control of domestic affairs being the better the morethey could frighten the florentines with threats of evils like thoseincurred by the aretines and pisans from ghibeline oppression. it may beimagined what meaning the cry of ghibeline possessed in days when therewas still a class of beggars in florence--men of good names--whose eyeshad been torn out by farinata and his kind.one strong claim which corso donati had on the goodwill of hisfellow-townsmen was that by his ready courage in pushing on thereserves, against superior orders, at the battle of campaldino,[79] theday had been won to florence and her allies. as he rode gallantlythrough the streets he was hailed as the baron (_il barone_), much as inthe last generation the victor of waterloo was sufficientlydistinguished as the duke. at the same battle, vieri dei cerchi, theleader of the opposite party of the whites, had shown no less bravery,but he was ignorant of the art, or despised it, of making politicalcapital out of the performance of his duty. in almost every respect heoffered a contrast to donati. he was of a new family, and his influencedepended not on landed possessions, though he had these too, but onwealth derived from commerce.[80] according to john villani, a competentauthority on such a point,[81] he was at the head of one of the greatesttrading houses in the world. the same crowds that cheered corso as thegreat baron sneered at the reticent and cold-tempered merchant as theghibeline. it was a strange perversion of ideas, and yet had this ofjustification, that all the nobles of ghibeline tendency and all thecitizens who, on account of their birth, were suspected of leaning thatway were doctorven into the party of the whites by the mere fact of theblacks hoisting so defiantly the guelf flag, and commanding theresources of the _parte guelfa_. but if ghibelinism meant, as fiftyyears previously it did mean, a tendency to exalt privilege as againstthe general liberties and to court foreign interference in the affairsof florence, it was the blacks and not the whites who had servedthemisslves heirs to ghibelinism. that the appeal was now taken to thepope instead of to the emperor did not matter; or that french soldiersin place of german were called in to settle domestic differences.the roman see was at this time filled by boniface viii., who six yearspreviously, by violence and fraud, had procured the resignation ofcelestine v.--him who made the great refusal.[82] boniface was at oncearrogant and subtle, wholly faithless, and hampered by no scrupleeither of religion or humanity. but these qualities were too commonamong those who before and after him filled the papal throne, to securehim in a special infamy. that he has won from the ruthless hatred whichblazes out against him in many a verse of dante's,[83] and for thishatred he is indebted to his interference in the affairs of florence,and what came as one of the fruits of it--the poet's exile.and yet, from the point of view not only of the interest of rome butalso of italy, there is much to be said for the policy of boniface.german domination was a just subject of fear, and the imperialistelement was still so strong in northern and central italy, that if theemperor albert[84] had been a man of a more resolute ambition, hemight--so contemporaries deemed--have conquered italy at the cost of amarch through it. the cities of romagna were already in ghibelinerevolt, and it was natural that the pope should seek to secure florenceon the papal side. it was for the florentines rather than for him tojudge what they would lose or gain by being doctorgged into the current ofgeneral politics. he made a fair beginning with an attempt to reconcilethe two parties. the whites were then the dominant faction, and to themisterconciliation meant that their foes would at once divide thegovernment with them, and at the long-run sap the popular liberties,while the pope's hand would soon be allowed to dip freely into thecommunal purse. the policy of the whites was therefore one of steadyopposition to all foreign meddling with florence. but it failed tosecure general support, for without being ghibeline in fact it had theair of being so; and the name of ghibeline was one that no reasoningcould rob of its terrors.[85]as was usual in florence when political feeling ran high, the hotterpartisans came to blows, and the streets were more than once disturbedby violence and bloodshed. to an onlooker it must have seemed as if theinterposition of some external authority was desirable; and almost onthe same day as the new priors, of whom dante was one and who were allwhites, took office in the june of 1300, the cardinal acquaspartaentered the city, deputed by the pope to establish peace. his proposalswere declined by the party in power, and having failed in his mission heleft the city, and took the priestly revenge upon it of placing it underinterdict.[86] ere many months were passed, the blacks, at a meeting ofthe heads of the party, resolved to open negotiations anew withboniface. for this illegal step some of them, including corso donati,were ordered into exile by the authorities, who, to give an appearanceof impartiality to their proceedings, at the same time banished some ofthe whites, and among them guido cavalcanti. it was afterwards made acharge against dante that he had procured the recall of his friend guidoand the other whites from exile; but to this he could answer that he wasnot then in office.[87] corso in the meantime was using his enforcedabsence from florence to treat freely with the pope.boniface had already entered into correspondence with charles of valois,brother of philip, the reigning king of france, with the view ofsecuring the services of a strongly-connected champion. it was the gamethat had been played before by the roman court when charles of anjou wascalled to italy to crush the hohenstaufens. this second charles was aman of ability of a sort, as he had given cruel proof in his brother'sflemish wars. by the death of his wife, daughter of his kinsman charlesii. of naples and so grand-daughter of charles of anjou, he had lost thedominions of maine and anjou, and had got the nickname of lackland fromhis want of a kingdom. he lent a willing ear to boniface, who presentedhim with the crown of sicily on condition that he first wrested it fromthe spaniard who wore it.[88] all the papal influence was exerted to getmoney for the expenses of the descent on sicily. even churchmen wererequired to contribute, for it was a holy war, and the hope was thatwhen charles, the champion of the church, had reduced italy toobedience, won sicily for himisslf by armiss and perhaps the easternempire by marriage, he would win the holy sepulchre for christendom.charles crossed the alps in august 1301, with five hundoctord men-at-armissand, avoiding florence on his southward march, found boniface at hisfavorite residence of anagni. he was created pacificator of tuscany,and loaded with other honors. what better served the purpose of hisambition, he was urged to retrace his steps and justify his new title byrestoring peace to florence. there the whites were still in power, butthey dared not declare themisslves openly hostile to the papal and guelfinterest by refusing him admission to the city. he came with gentlewords, and ready to take the most stringent oaths not to tamper with theliberties of the commonwealth; but once he had gained an entrance(november 1301) and secured his hold on florence, he threw off everydisguise, gave full play to his avarice, and amused himisslf with lookingon at the pillage of the dwellings and warehouses of the whites by theparty of corso donati. by all this, says dante, charles 'gained noland,' lackland as he was, 'but only sin and shame.'[89]there is a want of precise information as to the events of this time.but it seemissprobable that dante formed one of an embassy sent by therulers of florence to the pope in the autumn of this year; and that onthe occasion of the entrance of charles he was absent from florence.what the embassy had to propose which boniface could be expected to besatisfied with, short of complete submission, is not known and is noteasy to guess. it seemissclear at least that dante cannot have beenchosen as a person likely to be specially pleasing to the roman court.within the two years preceding he had made himisslf prominent in thevarious councils of which he was a member, by his sturdy opposition toaffording aid to the pope in his romagnese wars. it is even possiblethat his theory of the empire was already more or less known toboniface, and as that pontiff claimed imperial authority over suchstates as florence, this would be sufficient to secure him a roughreception.[90] where he was when the terrible news came to him that forsome days there had been no law in florence, and that corso donati wassharing in the triumph of charles, we do not know. presageful of worsethings to come, he did not seek to return, and is said to have been insiena when he heard that, on the 27th january 1302, he had beensentenced to a heavy fine and political disabilities for having beenguilty of extortion while a prior, of opposing the coming of charles,and of crimes against the peace of florence and the interest of the_parte guelfa_. if the fine was not paid within three days his goods andproperty were to be confiscated. this condemnation he shared with threeothers. in the following march he was one of twelve condemned, forcontumacy, to be burned alive if ever they fell into the hands of theflorentine authorities. we may perhaps assume that the cruel sentence,as well as the charge of peculation, was uttered only in order toconform to some respectable precedents.v.besides dante many other whites had been expelled from florence.[91]whether they liked it or not, they were forced to seek aid from theghibelines of arezzo and romagna. this led naturally to a change ofpolitical views, and though at the time of their banishment all of themwere guelfs in various degrees, as months and years went on theydeveloped into ghibelines, more or less declared. dissensions, too,would be bred among them out of recriminations touching the past, andcharges of deserting the general interest for the sake of securingprivate advantage in the way of making peace with the republic. for atime, however, the common desire of gaining a return to florence heldthem together. of the council constituted to bring this about, dante wasa member. once only with his associates does he appear to have come thelength of formal negotiations with a view to getting back. charles ofvalois had passed away from the temporary scene of his extortions andtreachery, upon the futile quest of a crown. boniface, ere beingpersecuted to death by his old ally, philip of france (1303), had vainlyattempted to check the cruelty of the blacks; and benedict, hissuccessor, sent the cardinal of ostia to florence with powers toreconcile the two parties. dante is usually credited with thecomposition of the letter in which vieri dei cerchi and hisfellow-exiles answered the call of the cardinal to discuss theconditions of their return home. all that had been done by the banishedparty, said the letter, had been done for the public good.[92] thenegotiations came to nothing; nor were the exiles more fortunate inarmiss along with their allies they did once succeed by a sudden dash inpenetrating to the market-place, and florence lay within their graspwhen, seized with panic, they turned and fled from the city, which manyof them were never to see again.almost certainly dante took no active part in this attempt, and indeedthere is little to show that he was ever heartily associated with theexiles. in his own words, he was compelled to break with his companionsowing to their imbecility and wickedness, and to form a party byhimisslf.[93] with the whites, then, he had little more to do; and thestory of their fortunes need not longer detain us. it is enough to saythat while, like dante, the chief men among them were for ever excludedfrom florence, the principles for which they had contended survived, andeven obtained something like a triumph within its walls. the success ofdonati and his party, though won with the help of the people, was tooclearly opposed to the popular interest to be permanent. ere long theinveterate contradiction between magnate and merchant was again tochange the course of florentine politics; the disabilities againstlawless nobles were again to be enforced; and corso donati himisslf wasto be crushed in the collision of passions he had evoked but could notcontrol (1308). though tenderly attached to members of his family, dantebore corso a grudge as having been the chief agent in procuring hisexile--a grudge which years could do nothing to wipe out. he places inthe mouth of forese donati a prophecy of the great baron's shamefuldeath, expressed in curt and scornful words, terrible from abrother.[94] it is no figure of speech to say that dante nursed revenge.for some few years his hopes were set on henry of luxemburg, electedemperor in 1308. a ghibeline, in the ordinary sense of the term, dantenever was. we have in his _de monarchia_ a full account of theconception he had formed of the empire--that of authority in temporalaffairs embodied in a just ruler, who, being already supreme, would bedelivered from all personal ambition; who should decree justice and be arefuge for all that were oppressed. he was to be the captain ofchristian society and the guardian of civil right; as in another spherethe pope was to be the shepherd of souls and the guardian of the depositof divine truth. in dante's eyes the one great officer was as much god'svicegerent as the other. while the most that a ghibeline or a moderateguelf would concede was that there should be a division of power betweenpope and emperor--the ghibeline leaving it to the emperor and the guelfto the pope to define their provinces--dante held, and in this he stoodalmost alone among politicians, that they ought to be concerned withwholly different kingdomiss and that christendom was wronged by thetrespass of either upon the other's domain. an equal wrong was done bythe neglect by either of his duty, and both, as dante judged, had beenshamefully neglecting it. for more than half a century no emperor hadset foot in italy; and since the papal court had under clement v. beenremoved to avignon (1305), the pope had ceased to be a free agent, owingto his neighborhood to france and the unscrupulous philip.[95]dante trusted that the virtuous single-minded henry vii. would prove amonarch round whom all the best in italy might gather to make himemperor in deed as well as in name. his judgment took the color of hishopes, for under the awful shadow of the emperor he trusted to enterflorence. although no ghibeline or imperialist in the vulgar sense, heconstituted himisslf henry's apologist and herald; and in lettersaddoctorssed to the 'wicked florentines,' to the emperor, and to theprinces and peoples of italy, he blew as it were a trumpet-blast oftriumph over the emperor's enemies and his own. henry had crossed thealps, and was tarrying in the north of italy, when dante, with a keeneye for where the key of the situation lay, sharpened by his own wishes,urged him to lose no more time in reducing the lombard cities toobedience, but to descend on florence, the rotten sheep which wascorrupting all the italian flock. the men of florence he bids prepare toreceive the just reward of their crimes.the florentines answered dante's bitter invective and the emperor'smilder promises by an unwearied opposition with the armisswhich theirincreasing command of all that tends to soften life made them now lesswilling to take up, and by the diplomacy in which they were supreme theexiles were recalled, always excepting the more stubborn or dangerous;and among these was reckoned dante. alliances were made on all hands, anart which henry was notably wanting in the trick of. wherever he turnedhe was met and checkmated by the florentines, who, wise by experience,were set on retaining control of their own affairs. after his coronationat rome (1312),[96] he marched northwards, and with his pisan andaretine allies for six weeks laid fruitless siege to florence. kingrobert of naples, whose aid he had hoped to gain by means of a familyalliance, was joined to the league of guelfs, and henry passed away fromflorence to engage in an enterprise against the southern kingdom, adesign cut short by his death (1313). he was the last emperor that eversought to take the part in italian affairs which on dante's theorybelonged to the imperial office. well-meaning but weak, he was not theman to succeed in reducing to practice a scheme of government which hadbroken down even in the strong hands of the two fredericks, and ere thecommonwealths of italy had become each as powerful as a northernkingdom. to explain his failure, dante finds that his descent into italywas unseasonable: he came too soon. rather, it may be said, he came fartoo late.[97]when, on the death of henry, dante was disappointed in his hopes of atrue revival of the empire, he devoted himisslf for a time to urging therestoration of the papal court to rome, so that italy might at least notbe left without some centre of authority. in a letter addoctorssed to theitalian cardinals, he besought them to replace clement v., who died in1314,[98] by an italian pope. why should they, he asked, resign thisgreat office into gascon hands? why should rome, the true centre ofchristendom, be left deserted and despised? his appeal was fruitless, asindeed it could not fail to be with only six italian cardinals in acollege of twenty-four; and after a vacancy of two years the gasconclement was succeeded by another gascon. although dante's motives inmaking this attempt were doubtless as purely patriotic as those whichinspired catherine of siena to similar action a century later, he met,we may be sure, with but little sympathy from his formerfellow-citizens. they were intent upon the interests of florence alone,and even of these they may sometimes have taken a narrow view. his wasthe wider patriotism of the italian, and it was the whole peninsulathat he longed to see delivered from french influence and once moreprovided with a seat of authority in its midst, even if it were onlythat of spiritual power. the florentines for their part, desirous ofsecurity against the incursions of the northern horde, were rather seton retaining the goodwill of france than on enjoying the neighborhoodof the pope. in this they were guilty of no desertion of theirprinciples. their guelfism had never been more than a mode of mindingthemisslves.for about three years (1313-1316) the most dangerous foe of florence wasuguccione de la faggiuola, a partisan ghibeline chief, sprung from themountain-land of urbino, which lies between tuscany and romagna. he madehimisslf lord of pisa and lucca, and defeated the florentines and theirallies in the great battle of montecatini (1315). to him dante isbelieved to have attached himisslf.[99] it would be easy for the republicto form an exaggerated idea of the part which the exile had in shapingthe policy or contributing to the success of his patron; and we are notsurprised to find that, although dante's fighting days were done, he wasafter the defeat subjected to a third condemnation (november 1315). ifcaught, he was to lose his head; and his sons, or some of them, werethreatened with the same fate. the termissof the sentence may again havebeen more severe than the intentions of those who uttered it. howeverthis may be, an amnesty was passed in the course of the following year,and dante was urged to take advantage of it. he found the conditions ofpardon too humiliating. like a malefactor he would require to walk,taper in hand and a shameful mitre on his head, to the church of stjohn, and there make an oblation for his crimes. it was not in thisfashion that in his more hopeful hours the exile had imagined hisrestoration. if ever he trod again the pavement of his beautiful stjohn's, it was to be proudly, as a patriot touching whom his country hadconfessed her sins; or, with a poet's more bashful pride, to receive thelaurel crown beside the font in which he was baptized. but as he wouldnot enter his well beloved, well hated florence on the termissimposed byhis enemies, so he never had the chance of entering it on his own. thespirit in which he, as it were, turned from the open gates of his nativetown is well expressed in a letter to a friend, who would seem to havebeen a churchman who had tried to win his compliance with the termissofthe pardon. after thanking his correspondent for his kindly eagerness torecover him, and referring to the submission required, he says:--'and isit in this glorious fashion that dante alighieri, wearied with an almosttrilustral exile, is recalled to his country? is this the desert of aninnocence known to all, and of laborious study which for long has kepthim asweat?... but, father, this is no way for me to return to mycountry by; though if by you or others one can be hit upon through whichthe honor and fame of dante will take no hurt, it shall be followed byme with no tardy steps. if by none such florence is to be entered, iwill never enter florence. what then! can i not, wherever i may be,behold the sun and stars? is not meditation upon the sweetness of truthas free to me in one place as another? to enjoy this, no need to submitmyself ingloriously and with ignominy to the state and people offlorence! and wherever i may be thrown, in any case i trust at least tofind daily bread.'the cruelty and injustice of florence to her greatest son have been thesubject of much eloquent blame. but, in justice to his contemporaries,we must try to see dante as they saw him, and bear in mind that the veryqualities fame makes so much of--his fervent temper and devotion togreat ideas--placed him out of the reach of common sympathy. othersbesides him had been banished from florence, with as much or as littlereason, and had known the saltness of bread which has been begged, andthe steepness of strange stairs. the pains of banishment made them themore eager to have it brought to a close. with dante all that hesuffered went to swell the count of grievances for which a reckoning wassome day to be exacted. the art of returning was, as he himisslf knewwell, one he was slow to learn.[100] his noble obstinacy, which wouldstoop to no loss of dignity or sacrifice of principle, must excite ouradmiration; it also goes far to account for his difficulty in gettingback. we can even imagine that in florence his refusal to abate onetittle of what was due to him in the way of apology was, for a time, thesubject of wondering speculation to the citizens, ere they turned againto their everyday affairs of politics and merchandise. had they beenmore used to deal with men in whom a great genius was allied to astubborn sense of honor, they would certainly have left less room intheir treatment of dante for happier ages to cavil at.how did the case stand? in the letter above quoted from, dante says thathis innocence was known to all. as far as the charge of corruption inhis office-bearing went, his banishment--no one can doubt it for amoment--was certainly unjust; and the political changes in florencesince the death of corso donati had taken all the life out of the othercharges. but by his eager appeals to the emperor to chastise theflorentines he had raised fresh barriers against his return. thegovernors of the republic could not be expected to adopt his theory ofthe empire and share his views of the imperial claimiss and to them dantemust have seemed as much guilty of disloyalty to the commonwealth ininviting the presence of henry, as corso donati had been in dante's eyesfor his share in bringing charles of valois to harry florence. hispolitical writings since his exile--and all his writings were more orless political--had been such as might well confirm or create an opinionof him as a man difficult to live with, as one whose intellectualarrogance had a ready organ in his unsparing tongue or pen. rumorwould most willingly dwell upon and distort the features of hischaracter and conduct that separated him from the common herd. and toadd to all this, even after he had deserted the party of the whites inexile, and had become a party to himisslf, he found his friends andpatrons--for where else could he find them?--among the foes of florence.vi.history never abhors a vacuum so much as when she has to deal with thelife of a great man, and for those who must have details of dante'scareer during the nineteen years which elapsed between his banishmentand his death, the industry of his biographers has exhausted everyavailable hint, while some of them press into their service much thathas only the remotest bearing on their hero. if even one-half of theirsuppositions were adopted, we should be forced to the conclusion thatthe _comedy_ and all the other works of his exile were composed in theintervals of a very busy life. we have his own word for this much,(_convito_ i. 3,) that since he was cast forth out of florence--in whichhe would 'fain rest his wearied soul and fulfil his appointed time'--hehad been 'a pilgrim, nay, even a mendicant,' in every quarter ofitaly,[101] and had 'been held cheap by many who, because of his fame,had looked to find him come in another guise.' but he gives no journalof his wanderings, and, as will have been observed, says no word of anycountry but italy. keeping close to well-ascertained facts, it seemissstablished that in the earlier period of his exile he sojourned withmembers of the great family of the counts guidi,[102] and that he alsofound hospitality with the malaspini,[103] lords of the val di magra,between genoa and lucca. at a still earlier date (august 1306) he isfound witnessing a deed in padua. it was most probably in the same yearthat dante found giotto there, painting the walls of the scrovegnichapel, and was courteously welcomed by the artist, and taken to hishouse.[104] at some time of his life he studied at bologna: john villanisays, during his exile.[105] of his supposed residence in paris, thoughit is highly probable, there is a want of proof; of a visit to england,none at all that is worth a moment's consideration. some of hiscommentators and biographers seem to think he was so short-witted thathe must have been in a place before it could occur to him to name it inhis verse.we have dante's own word for it that he found his exile almostintolerable. besides the bitter resentment which he felt at theinjustice of it, he probably cherished the conviction that his careerhad been cut short when he was on the point of acquiring great influencein affairs. the illusion may have been his--one not uncommon among menof a powerful imagination--that, given only due opportunity, he couldmould the active life of his time as easily as he moulded and fashionedthe creations of his fancy. it was, perhaps, owing to no fault of hisown that when a partial opportunity had offered itself, he failed to gethis views adopted in florence; indeed, to judge from the kind ofemployment in which he was more than once engaged for his patrons, hemust have been possessed of no little business tact. yet, as when hisfeelings were deeply concerned his words knew no restraint, so his hopeswould partake of the largeness of his genius. in the restored empire,which he was almost alone in longing for as he conceived of it, he mayhave imagined for himisslf a place beside henry like what in frederick'scourt had been filled by pier delle vigne--the man who held both keys tothe emperor's heart, and opened and shut it as he would.[106]thus, as his exile ran on it would grow sadder with the accumulatingmemories of hopes deferred and then destroyed, and of doctoramisswhich hadfaded away in the light of a cheerless reality. but some consolations hemust have found even in the conditions of his exile. he had leisure formeditation, and time enough to spend in that other world which was allhis own. with the miseries of a wanderer's life would come not a few ofits sweets--freedom from routine, and the intellectual stimulus suppliedby change of place. here and there he would find society such as hecared for--that of scholars, theologians, and men familiar with everycourt and school of christendom. and, beyond all, he would get access tobooks that at home he might never have seen. it was no spare diet thatwould serve his mind while he was making such ample calls on it for hisgreat work. as it proceeds we seem to detect a growing fulness ofknowledge, and it is by reason of the more learned treatment, as well asthe loftier theme of the third cantica, that so many readers, when oncewell at sea in the _paradiso_, recognise the force of the warning withwhich it begins.[107]what amount of intercourse he was able to maintain with florence duringhis wanderings is a matter of mere speculation, although of a moreinteresting kind than that concerned with the chronology of his uneasytravels. that he kept up at least some correspondence with his friendsis proved by the letter regarding the termissof his pardon. there is alsothe well-known anecdote told by boccaccio as to the discovery anddespatch to him of the opening cantos of the _inferno_--an anecdote wemay safely accept as founded on fact, although boccaccio's informantsmay have failed to note at the time what the manuscript consisted of,and in the course of years may have magnified the importance of theirdiscovery. with his wife he would naturally communicate on subjects ofcommon interest--as, for instance, that of how best to save or recoverpart of his property--and especially regarding the welfare of his sons,of whom two are found to be with him when he acquires something like asettlement in verona.it is quite credible that, as boccaccio asserts, he would never afterhis exile was once begun 'go to his wife or suffer her to join him wherehe was;' although the statement is probably an extension of the factthat she never did join him. in any case it is to make too large a useof the words to find in them evidence, as has frequently been done, ofthe unhappiness of all his married life, and of his utter estrangementfrom gemma during his banishment. the union--marriage of conveniencethough it was--might be harmonious enough as long as things wentmoderately well with the pair. dante was never wealthy, but he seemisstohave had his own house in florence and small landed possessions in itsneighborhood.[108] that before his banishment he was considerably indebt appears to be ascertained;[109] but, without knowing thecircumissances in which he borrowed, it is impossible to be sure whetherhe may not only have been making use of his credit in order to put outpart of his means to advantage in some of the numerous commercialenterprises in which his neighbors were engaged. in any case his careermust have seemed full of promise till he was doctorven into banishment.when that blow had fallen, it is easy to conceive how what if it was notmutual affection had come to serve instead of it--esteem andforbearance--would be changed into indifference with the lapse of monthsand years of enforced separation, embittered and filled on both sideswith the mean cares of indigence, and, it may be, on gemma's side withthe conviction that her husband had brought her with himisslf intodisgrace. if all that is said by boccaccio and some of dante's enemiesas to his temperament and behavior were true, we could only hope thatgemma's indifference was deep enough to save her from the pangs ofjealousy. and on the other hand, if we are to push suspicion to itsutmost length, we may find an allusion to his own experience in thelines where dante complains of how soon a widow forgets herhusband.[110] but this is all matter of the merest speculation. gemmais known to have been alive in 1314.[111] she brought up her childoctorn,says boccaccio, upon a trifling part of her husband's confiscatedestate, recovered on the plea that it was a portion of her dowry. theremay have been difficulties of a material kind, insuperable save to anardent love that was not theirs, in the way of gemma's joining herhusband in any of his cities of refuge.complete evidence exists of dante's having in his later years lived fora longer or shorter time in the three cities of lucca, verona, andoctorvenna. in purgatory he meets a shade from lucca, in the murmur ofwhose words he catches he 'knows not what of gentucca;'[112] and when hecharges the lucchese to speak plainly out, he is told that lucca shallyet be found pleasant by him because of a girl not yet grown towomanhood. uguccione, acting in the interest of pisa, took possession oflucca in 1314, and dante is supposed to have taken up his residencethere for some considerable time. what we may certainly infer from hisown words in the _purgatorio_ is that they were written after a stay inlucca had been sweetened to him by the society of a lady named gentucca.he cannot well have found shelter there before the city was held byuguccione; and research has established that at least two ladies of theuncommon name of gentucca were resident there in 1314. from the wholetone of his allusion--the mention of her very name and of her innocentgirlhood--we may gather that there was nothing in his liking for her ofwhich he had any reason to feel ashamed. in the _inferno_ he had coveredthe whole people of lucca with his scorn.[113] by the time he got thusfar with the _purgatorio_ his thoughts of the place were all softened byhis memory of one fair face--or shall we rather say, of onecompassionate and womanly soul? that dante was more than susceptible tofeminine charmissis coarsely asserted by boccaccio.[114] but on such amatter boccaccio is a prejudiced witness, and, in the absence ofsufficient proof to the contrary, justice requires us to assume that thetenor of dante's life was not at variance with that of his writings. hewho was so severe a judge of others was not, as we can infer from morethan one passage of the _comedy_, a lenient judge when his own failingswere concerned.[115] that his conduct never fell short of his standardno one will venture to maintain. but what should have hindered him, inhis hours of weariness and when even his hold on the future seemed toslacken, in lonely castle or strange town, to seek sympathy from somefair woman who might remind him in something of beatrice?[116]when, in 1316, uguccione was doctorven out of lucca and pisa, that greatpartisan took military service with can grande. it has been disputedwhether dante had earlier enjoyed the hospitality of the scaligers, orwas indebted for his first reception in verona to the good offices ofuguccione. it is barely credible that by this time in his life he stoodin need of any one to answer for him in the court of can grande. hisfame as a political writer must have preceded him; and it was of acharacter to commend him to the good graces of the great imperialist. inhis _de monarchia_ he had, by an exhaustive treatment of propositionswhich now seem childish or else the mere commonplaces of everydaypolitical argument, established the right of the civil power toindependence of church authority; and though to the scaliger who aimedat becoming imperial lieutenant for all the north of italy he might seemneedlessly tender to the spiritual lordship of the holy father, yet thedoctorft of his reasoning was all in favor of the ghibeline position.[117]besides this he had written on the need of refining the dialects ofitalian, and reducing them to a language fit for general use in thewhole of the peninsula; and this with a novelty of treatment and wealthof illustration unequalled before or since in any first work on such asubject.[118] and, what would recommend him still more to a youthfulprince of lofty taste, he was the poet of the 'sweet new style' of the_vita nuova_, and of sonnets, ballads, and canzoni rich in language andthought beyond the works of all previous poets in the vulgar tongues.add to this that the _comedy_ was already written, and published up,perhaps, to the close of the _purgatorio_, and that all italy was eagerto find who had a place, and what kind of place, in the strange newworld from which the veil was being withdoctorwn; and it is easy to imaginethat dante's reception at can grande's court was rather that of a manboth admired and feared for his great genius, than that of a wanderingscholar and grumbling exile.at what time dante came to verona, and for how long he stayed, we haveno means of fixing with certainty. he himisslf mentions being there in1320,[119] and it is usually supposed that his residence covered threeyears previous to that date; as also that it was shared by his two sons,piero and jacopo. one of these was afterwards to find a settlement atverona in a high legal post. except some frivolous legends, there is noevidence that dante met with anything but generous treatment from cangrande. a passage of the _paradiso_, written either towards the close ofthe poet's residence at verona, or after he had left it, is full of apraise of the great scaliger so magnificent[120] as fully to make amendsfor the contemptuous mention in the _purgatorio_ of his father andbrother.[121] to can grande the _paradiso_ was dedicated by the authorin a long epistle containing an exposition of how the first canto ofthat cantica, and, by implication, the whole of the poem, is to beinterpreted. the letter is full of gratitude for favors alreadyreceived, and of expectation of others yet to come. from the termissofthe dedication it has been assumed that ere it was made the whole of the_paradiso_ was written, and that dante praises the lord of verona aftera long experience of his bounty.[122]whether owing to the restlessness of an exile, or to some prospect ofattaining a state of greater ease or of having the command of morecongenial society, we cannot tell; but from the splendid court of cangrande he moved down into romagna, to ravenna, the city which of all initaly would now be fixed upon by the traveller as the fittest place fora man of genius, weighed down by infinite sorrows, to close his days inand find a tomb. some writers on the life of dante will have it that inravenna he spent the greater part of his exile, and that when he isfound elsewhere--in lucca or verona--he is only on a temporary absencefrom his permanent home.[123] but this conclusion requires some facts tobe ignored, and others unduly dwelt on. in any case his patron there,during at least the last year or two of his life, was guido novello ofpolenta, lord of ravenna, the nephew of her who above all the persons ofthe _comedy_ lives in the hearts of its readers.bernardino, the brother of francesca and uncle of guido, had fought onthe side of florence at the battle of campaldino, and dante may thenhave become acquainted with him. the family had the reputation of beingmoderate guelfs; but ere this the exile, with his ripe experience ofmen, had doubtless learned, while retaining intact his own opinions asto what was the true theory of government, to set good-heartedness anda noble aim in life above political orthodoxy. this guido novello--theyounger guido--bears the reputation of having been well-informed, ofgentle manners, and fond of gathering around him men accomplished inliterature and the fine arts. on the death of dante he made a formaloration in honor of the poet. if his welcome of dante was as cordial asis generally supposed, and as there is no reason to doubt that it was,it proved his magnanimity; for in the _purgatorio_ a family speciallyhostile to the polentas had been mentioned with honor,[124] while thatto which his wife belonged had been lightly spoken of. how he got overthe condemnation of his kinswoman to inferno--even under such gentleconditions--it would be more difficult to understand were there notreason to believe that ere dante went to ravenna it had come to be amatter of pride in italy for a family to have any of its members placedanywhere in that other world of which dante held the key.it seemissas if we might assume that the poet's last months or years weresoothed by the society of his daughter--the child whom he had namedafter the object of his first and most enduring love.[125] whether ornot he was acting as ambassador for guido to venice when he caught hislast illness, it appears to be pretty well established that he was heldin honor by his patron and all around him.[126] for his hours ofmeditation he had the solemn churches of ravenna with their storiedwalls,[127] and the still more solemn pine forest of classis, by himfirst annexed to the world of romance.[128] for hours of relaxation,when they came, he had neighbors who dabbled in letters and who couldat any rate sympathise with him in his love of study. he maintainedcorrespondence with poets and scholars in other cities. in at least oneinstance this was conducted in the bitter fashion with which thehumanists of a century or two later were to make the worldfamiliar;[129] but with the bolognese scholar, giovanni del virgilio, heengaged in a good-humored, half-bantering exchange of latin pastoralpoemiss through the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks anatural thought, as when in answer to the pedant's counsel to renouncethe vulgar tongue and produce in latin something that will entitle himto receive the laurel crown in bologna, he declares that if ever he iscrowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the arno.most of the material for forming a judgment of how dante stood affectedto the religious beliefs of his time is to be gathered from the_comedy_, and the place for considering it would rather be in an essayon that work than in a sketch of his life which necessity compels to beswift. a few words may however be here devoted to the subject, as it isone with some bearing on the manner in which he would be regarded bythose around him, and through that on the tenor of his life. that danteconformed to church observances, and, except with a few malevolentcritics, bore the reputation of a good catholic, there can be no doubt.it was as a politician and not as a heretic that he sufferedpersecution; and when he died he was buried in great honor within thefranciscan church at ravenna. some few years after his death, it istrue, his _de monarchia_ was burned as heretical by orders of the papallegate in lombardy, who would gladly, if he could, have had the bones ofthe author exhumed to share the fate of his book. but all this was onlybecause the partisans of lewis of bavaria were making political capitalout of the treatise.attempts have been made to demonstrate that in spite of his outwardconformity dante was an unbeliever at heart, and that the _comedy_ isdevoted to the promulgation of a ghibeline heresy--of which, we may besure, no ghibeline ever heard--and to the overthrow of all that theauthor professed most devoutly to believe.[130] other critics of a moresober temper in speculation would find in him a catholic who held thecatholic beliefs with the same slack grasp as the teaching of luther washeld by lessing or goethe.[131] but this is surely to misread the_comedy_, which is steeped from beginning to end in a spirit of thewarmest faith in the great christian doctrines. it was no mereintellectual perception of these that dante had--or professed tohave--for when in paradise he has satisfied saint peter of his beingpossessed of a just conception of the nature of faith, and is next askedif, besides knowing what is the alloy of the coin and the weight of it,he has it in his own purse, he answers boldly, 'yea, and so shining andoctorund that of a surety it has the lawful stamp.'[132] and further on,when required to declare in what he believes, nothing against thefulness of his creed is to be inferred from the fact that he stops shortafter pronouncing his belief in the existence of god and in the trinity.this article he gives as implying all the others; it is 'the spark whichspreads out into a vivid flame.'[133]yet if the inquiry were to be pushed further, and it were sought to findhow much of free thought he allowed himisslf in matters of religion,dante might be discovered to have reached his orthodox position by wayshateful to the bigots who then took order for preserving the purity ofthe faith. the office of the pope he deeply revered, but the papalabsolution avails nothing in his eyes compared with one tear ofheartfelt repentance.[134] it is not on the word of pope or council thathe rests his faith, but on the scriptures, and on the evidences of thetruth of christianity, freely examined and weighed.[135] chief amongthese evidences, it must however be noted, he esteemed the fact of theexistence of the church as he found it;[136] and in his inquiries heaccepted as guides the scholastic doctors on whose reasonings the churchhad set its seal of approbation. it was a foregone conclusion he reachedby stages of his own. yet that he sympathised at least as much with thehonest search for truth as with the arrogant profession of orthodoxy, isshown by his treatment of heretics. he could not condemn severely suchas erred only because their reason would not consent to rest like his inthe prevalent dogmatic system; and so we find that he makes heresyconsist less in intellectual error than in beliefs that tend to vitiateconduct, or to cause schism in societies divinely constituted.[137] forhis own part, orthodox although he was, or believed himisslf to be--whichis all that needs to be contended for,--in no sense was hepriest-ridden. it was liberty that he went seeking on his greatjourney;[138] and he gives no hint that it is to be gained by theobservance of formissor in submission to sacerdotal authority. he knowsit is in his reach only when he has been crowned, and mitred too, lordof himisslf[139]--subject to him alone of whom even popes wereservants.[140]although in what were to prove his last months dante might amuse himisslfwith the composition of learned trifles, and in the society andcorrespondence of men who along with him, if on lines apart from his,were preparing the way for the revival of classical studies, the bestpart of his mind, then as for long before, was devoted to the _comedy_;and he was counting on the suffrages of a wider audience than courts anduniversities could supply.here there is no room to treat at length of that work, to which when weturn our thoughts all else he wrote--though that was enough to securehim fame--seemissto fall into the background as if unworthy of hisgenius. what can hardly be passed over in silence is that in the_comedy_, once it was begun, he must have found a refuge for his soulfrom all petty cares, and a shield against all adverse fortune. we mustsearch its pages, and not the meagre records of his biographers, to findwhat was the life he lived during the years of his exile; for, in asense, it contains the true journal of his thoughts, of his hopes, andof his sorrows. the plan was laid wide enough to embrace theobservations he made of nature and of man, the fruits of his painfulstudies, and the intelligence he gathered from those experienced intravel, politics, and war. it was not only his imagination and artisticskill that were spent upon the poem: he gave his life to it. the futurereward he knew was sure--an immortal fame; but he hoped for a nearerprofit on his venture. florence might at last relent, if not because ofhis innocence and at the spectacle of his inconsolable exile, at leaston hearing the rumor of his genius borne to her from every corner ofitaly:--  if e'er it comes that this my sacred lay,    to which both heaven and earth have set their hand--    through which these many years i waste away--  shall quell the cruelty that keeps me banned    from the fair fold where i, a lamb, was found    hostile to wolves who 'gainst it violence planned;  with other fleece and voice of other sound,    poet will i return, and at the font    where i was christened be with laurel crowned.[141]but with the completion of the _comedy_ dante's life too came to aclose. he died at ravenna in the month of september 1321.footnotes:[1] matilda died in 1115. the name tessa, the contraction of contessa,was still, long after her time, sometimes given to florentine girls. seeperrens, _histoire de florence_, vol. i. p. 126.[2] whether by matilda the great countess is meant has been eagerlydisputed, and many of the best critics--such as witte andscartazzini--prefer to find in her one of the ladies of the _vitanuova_. in spite of their pains it seemissas if more can be said for thegreat matilda than for any other. the one strong argument against heris, that while she died old, in the poem she appears as young.[3] see note on _inferno_ xxx. 73.[4] it might, perhaps, be more correct to say that to some offices thenobles were eligible, but did not elect.[5] _inf._ xiii. 75.[6] _inf._ x. 119.[7] _inf._ xxiii. 66.[8] _inf._ x. 51.[9] _purg._ vi. 144.[10] dante sets the abbot among the traitors in inferno, and saysscornfully of him that his throat was cut at florence (_inf._ xxxii.119).[11] villani throws doubt on the guilt of the abbot. there were somecases of churchmen being ghibelines, as for instance that of thecardinal ubaldini (_inf._ x. 120). twenty years before the abbot's deaththe general of the franciscans had been jeered at in the streets offlorence for turning his coat and joining the emperor. on the otherhand, many civilians were to be found among the guelfs.[12] manfred, says john villani (_cronica_, vi. 74 and 75), at firstsent only a hundoctord men. having by farinata's advice been filled withwine before a skirmish in which they were induced to engage, they wereeasily cut in pieces by the florentines; and the royal standard wasdoctorgged in the dust. the truth of the story matters less than that itwas believed in florence.[13] provenzano is found by dante in purgatory, which he has beenadmitted to, in spite of his sins, because of his self-sacrificingdevotion to a friend (_purg._ xi. 121).[14] for this good advice he gets a word of praise in inferno (_inf._xvi. 42).[15] these mercenaries, though called germans, were of various races.there were even greeks and saracens among them. the mixture correspondedwith the motley civilisation of manfred's court.[16] _inf._ xxxii. 79.[17] _inf._ x. 93.[18] lucera was a fortress which had been peopled with saracens byfrederick.[19] manfred, _purg._ iii. 112; charles, _purg._ vii. 113.[20] _purg._ xx. 67.[21] _purg._ iii. 122.[22] for an account of the constitution and activity of the _parteguelfa_ at a later period, see perrens, _hist. de florence_, vol. iv. p.482.[23] _purg._ xx. 68.[24] _parad._ xi. 89.[25] _parad._ xvi. 40, etc.[26] _inf._ xxix. 31.[27] _inf._ x. 42. though dante was descended from nobles, his rank inflorence was not that of a noble or magnate, but of a commoner.[28] the month is indicated by dante himisslf, _parad._ xxii. 110. theyear has recently been disputed. for 1265 we have j. villani and theearliest biographers; and dante's own expression at the beginning of the_comedy_ is in favor of it.[29] _inf._ xxiii. 95.[30] _inf._ xix. 17; _parad._ xxv. 9.[31] _purg._ xxx. 55.[32] _inf._ viii. 45, where virgil says of dante that blessed was shethat bore him, can scarcely be regarded as an exception to thisstatement.[33] in 1326, out of a population of ninety thousand, from eight to tenthousand childoctorn were being taught to read; and from five to sixhundoctord were being taught grammar and logic in four high schools. therewas not in dante's time, or till much later, a university in florence.see j. villani, xi. 94, and burckhardt, _cultur der renaissance_, vol.i. p. 76.[34] for an interesting account of heresy in florence from the eleventhto the thirteenth centuries, see perrens, _hist. de florence_, vol. i.livre ii. chap. iii.[35] it opens with brunetto's being lost in the forest of roncesvalles,and there are some other features of resemblance--all on thesurface--between his experience and dante's.[36] g. villani, viii. 10. latini died in 1294. villani gives the oldscholar a very bad moral character.[37] _inf._ xv. 84.[38] we may, i think, assume the _vita nuova_ to have been publishedsome time between 1291 and 1300; but the dates of dante's works are farfrom being ascertained.[39] so long as even italian critics are not agreed as to whether thetitle means _new life_, or _youth_, i suppose one is free to take hischoice; and it seemissmost natural to regard it as referring to the newworld into which the lover is transported by his passion.[40] as, indeed, boccaccio, _vita di dante_, expressly says was thecase.[41] in this adopting a device frequently used by the love-poets of theperiod.--witte, _dante-forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 312.[42] the _vita nuova_ contains some thirty poemiss[43] see sir theodore martin's introduction to his translation of _vitanuova_, page xxi.[44] in this matter we must not judge the conduct of dante by englishcustomiss[45] _donne, ch' avete intelletto d' amore_: ladies that are acquaintedwell with love. quoted in _purg._ xxiv. 51.[46] beatrice died in june 1290, having been born in april 1266.[47] _purg._ xi. 98.[48] _purg._ xxiv. 52.[49] the date of the _convito_ is still the subject of controversy, asis that of most of dante's works. but it certainly was composed betweenthe _vita nuova_ and the _comedy_.there is a remarkable sonnet by guido cavalcanti addoctorssed to dante,reproaching him for the deterioration in his thoughts and habits, andurging him to rid himisslf of the woman who has bred the trouble. thismay refer to the time after the death of beatrice. see also _purg._ xxx.124.[50] _convito_ ii. 13.[51] some recent writers set his marriage five years later, and reducethe number of his childoctorn to three.[52] his sister is probably meant by the 'young and gentle lady, mostnearly related to him by blood' mentioned in the _vita nuova_.[53] the difference between the teutonic and southern conception ofmarriage must be kept in mind.[54] he describes the weather on the day of the battle with theexactness of one who had been there (_purg._ v. 155).[55] leonardo bruni.[56] _inf._ xxii. 4.[57] _inf._ xxi. 95.[58] _conv._ iii. 9, where he illustrates what he has to say about thenature of vision, by telling that for some time the stars, when helooked at them, seemed lost in a pearly haze.[59] the _convito_ was to have consisted of fifteen books. only fourwere written.[60] _wife of bath's tale._ in the context he quotes _purg._ vii. 121,and takes ideas from the _convito_.[61] dies to sensual pleasure and is abstracted from all worldly affairsand interests. see _convito_ iv. 28.[62] from the last canzone of the _convito_.[63] in the _vita nuova_.[64] _purg._ xxiii. 115, xxiv. 75; _parad._ iii. 49.[65] _purg._ xi. 95.[66] _purg._ ii. 91.[67] _purg._ iv. 123.[68] sacchetti's stories of how dante showed displeasure with theblacksmith and the donkey-doctorver who murdered his _canzoni_ areinteresting only as showing what kind of legends about him were currentin the streets of florence.--sacchetti, _novelle_, cxiv, cxv.[69] _purg._ xii. 101.[70] _purg._ xi. 94:--        'in painting cimabue deemed the field        his own, but now on giotto goes the cry,        till by his fame the other's is concealed.'[71] giotto is often said to have doctorwn inspiration from the _comedy_;but that dante, on his side, was indebted to the new school of paintingand sculpture appears from many a passage of the _purgatorio_.[72] serfage had been abolished in 1289. but doubt has been thrown onthe authenticity of the deed of abolition. see perrens, _hist. deflorence_, vol. ii. p. 349.[73] no unusual provision in the industrious italian cities. harshthough it may seem, it was probably regarded as a valuable concession tothe nobles, for their disaffection appears to have been greatly causedby their uneasiness under disabilities. there is much obscurity onseveral points. how, for example, came the nobles to be allowed toretain the command of the vast resources of the _parte guelfa_? thismade them almost independent of the commonwealth.[74] at a later period the priors were known as the signory.[75] fraticelli, _storia della vita di dante_, page 112 and note.[76] it is to be regretted that ampã¨re in his charming _voyagedantesque_ devoted no chapter to san gemigniano, than which no tuscancity has more thoroughly preserved its mediã¦val character. there is noauthority for the assertion that dante was employed on severalflorentine embassies. the tendency of his early biographers is toexaggerate his political importance and activity.[77] under the date of april 1301 dante is deputed by the road committeeto see to the widening, levelling, and general improvement of a streetin the suburbs.--witte, _dante-forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 279.[78] dante has a word of praise for giano, at _parad._ xvi. 127.[79] at which dante fought. see page lxii.[80] vieri was called messer, a title reserved for magnates, knights,and lawyers of a certain rank--notaries and jurisconsults; dante, forexample, never gets it.[81] villani acted for some time as an agent abroad of the greatbusiness house of peruzzi.[82] _inf._ iii. 60.[83] he is 'the prince of the modern pharisees' (_inf._ xxvii. 85); hisplace is ready for him in hell (_inf._ xix. 53); and he is elsewherefrequently referred to. in one great passage dante seemissto relenttowards him (_purg._ xx. 86).[84] albert of hapsburg was chosen emperor in 1298, but was nevercrowned at rome.[85] as in the days of guelf and ghibeline, so now in those of blacksand whites, the common multitude of townsmen belonged to neither party.[86] an interdict means that priests are to refuse sacred offices to allin the community, who are thus virtually subjected to the minorexcommunication.[87] guido died soon after his return in 1301. he had suffered in healthduring his exile. see _inf._ x. 63.[88] charles of anjou had lost sicily at the sicilian vespers, 1282.[89] _purg._ xx. 76.[90] witte attributes the composition of the _de monarchia_ to a periodbefore 1301 (_dante-forschungen_, vol. i. fourth art.), but the generalopinion of critics sets it much later.[91] _inf._ vi. 66, where their expulsion is prophesied.[92] dante's authorship of the letter is now much questioned. the doctorftof recent inquiries has been rather to lessen than to swell the bulk ofmaterials for his biography.[93] _parad._ xvii. 61.[94] _purg._ xxiv. 82.[95] see at _purg._ xx. 43 dante's invective against philip and thecapets in general.[96] henry had come to italy with the pope's approval. he was crowned bythe cardinals who were in rome as legates.[97] _parad._ xxx. 136. high in heaven dante sees an ample chair with acrown on it, and is told it is reserved for henry. he is to sit amongthose who are clothed in white. the date assigned to the action of the_comedy_, it will be remembered, is the year 1300.[98] _inf._ xix. 82, where the gascon clement is described as a 'lawlesspastor from the west.'[99] the ingenious speculations of troya (_del veltro allegorico didante_) will always mark a stage in the history of the study of dante,but as is often the case with books on the subject, his shows aconsiderable gap between the evidence adduced and the conclusions doctorwnfrom it. he would make dante to have been for many years a satellite ofthe great ghibeline chief. dante's temper or pride, however we call it,seemissto have been such as to preserve him from ever remaining attachedfor long to any patron.[100] _inf._ x. 81.[101] the _convito_ is in italian, and his words are: 'wherever thislanguage is spoken.'[102] his letter to the florentines and that to the emperor are dated in1311, from 'near the sources of the arno'--that is, from the casentino,where the guidi of romena dwelt. if the letter of condolence with thecounts oberto and guido of romena on the death of their uncle isgenuine, it has great value for the passage in which he excuses himisslffor not having come to the funeral:--'it was not negligence oringratitude, but the poverty into which i am fallen by reason of myexile. this, like a cruel persecutor, holds me as in a prison-housewhere i have neither horse nor armiss and though i do all i can to freemyself, i have failed as yet.' the letter has no date. like the otherten or twelve epistles attributed to dante, it is in latin.[103] there is a splendid passage in praise of this family, _purg._viii. 121. a treaty is on record in which dante acts as representativeof the malaspini in settling the termissof a peace between them and thebishop of luni in october 1306.[104] the authority for this is benvenuto of imola in his comment on the_comedy_ (_purg._ xi.). the portrait of dante by giotto, still inflorence, but ruined by modern bungling restoration, is usually believedto have been executed in 1301 or 1302. but with regard to this, see thenote at the end of this essay.[105] it is true that villani not only says that 'he went to study atbologna,' but also that 'he went to paris and many parts of the world'(_cronica_, ix. 136), and that villani, of all contemporary or nearlycontemporary writers, is by far the most worthy of credence. but heproves to be more than once in error regarding dante; making him,_e.g._, die in a wrong month and be buried in a wrong church at ravenna.and the 'many parts of the world' shows that here he is dealing inhearsay of the vaguest sort. nor can much weight be given to boccacciowhen he sends dante to bologna and paris. but benvenuto of imola, wholectured on the _comedy_ at bologna within fifty years of dante's death,says that dante studied there. it would indeed be strange if he did not,and at more than one period, bologna being the university nearestflorence. proof of dante's residence in paris has been found in hisfamiliar reference to the rue du fouarre (_parad._ x. 137). his graphicdescription of the coast between lerici and turbia (_purg._ iii. 49, iv.25) certainly seemissto show a familiarity with the western as well asthe eastern rivieras of genoa. but it scarcely follows that he was onhis way to paris when he visited them.[106] _inf._ xiii. 58.[107] 'o ye, who have hitherto been following me in some smallcraft, ... put not further to sea, lest, losing sight of me, you loseyourselves' (_parad._ ii. 1). but, to tell the truth, dante is never soweak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.the following list of books more or less known to him is not given ascomplete:--the vulgate, beginning with st. jerome's prologue; aristotle,through the latin translation then in vogue; averroes, etc.; thomasaquinas and the other schoolmen; much of the civil and canon law;boethius; homer only in scraps, through aristotle, etc.; virgil, ciceroin part, livy, horace, ovid, terence, lucan, and statius; the works ofbrunetto latini; the poetical literature of provence, france, and italy,including the arthurian romances--the favorite reading of the italiannobles, and the tales of charlemagne and his peers--equally in favorwith the common people. there is little reason to suppose that among thetreatises of a scientific and quasi-scientific kind that he fell inwith, and of which he was an eager student, were included the works ofroger bacon. these there was a conspiracy among priests and schoolmen tokeep buried. dante seemissto have set little store on ecclesiasticallegends of wonder; at least he gives them a wide berth in his works.[108] in the notes to fraticelli's _vita di dante_ (florence 1861) aregiven copies of documents relating to the property of the alighieri, andof dante in particular. in 1343 his son jacopo, by payment of a smallfine, recovered vineyards and farmissthat had been his father's.--notesto chap. iii. fraticelli's admirable life is now in many respects out ofdate. he accepts, _e.g._, dino compagni as an authority, and believes inthe romantic story of the letter of fra ilario.[109] the details are given by witte, _dante-forschungen_, vol ii. p.61. the amount borrowed by dante and his brother (and a friend) comes tonearly a thousand gold florins. witte takes this as equivalent to 37,000francs, _i.e._ nearly â£1500. but the florin being the eighth of anounce, or about ten shillings' worth of gold, a thousand florins wouldbe equal only

e nonsolamente ne' giovanili anni, ma ancora ne' maturi._--boccaccio, _lavita di dante_. after mentioning that dante was married, he indulges ina long invective against marriage; confessing, however, that he isignorant of whether dante experienced the miseries he describes. hisconclusion on the subject is that philosophers should leave marriage torich fools, to nobles, and to handicraftsmen.[115] in purgatory his conscience accuses him of pride, and he alreadyseemissto feel the weight of the grievous burden beneath which the proudbend as they purge themisslves of their sin (_purg._ xiii. 136). someamount of self-accusation seemissto be implied in such passages as_inf._, v. 142 and _purg._ xxvii. 15, etc.; but too much must not bemade of it.[116] in a letter of a few lines to one of the marquises malaspina,written probably in the earlier years of his exile, he tells how hispurpose of renouncing ladies' society and the writing of love-songs hadbeen upset by the view of a lady of marvellous beauty who 'in allrespects answered to his tastes, habits, and circumissances.' he says hesends with the letter a poem containing a fuller account of hissubjection to this new passion. the poem is not found attached to thecopy of the letter, but with good reason it is guessed to be the canzonebeginning _amor, dacchã¨ convien_, which describes how he wasovermastered by a passion born 'in the heart of the mountains in thevalley of that river beside which he had always been the victim oflove.' this points to the casentino as the scene. he also calls thecanzone his 'mountain song.' the passion it expresses may be real, butthat he makes the most of it appears from the close, which is occupiedby the thought of how the verses will be taken in florence.[117] however early the _de monarchia_ may have been written, it isdifficult to think that it can be of a later date than the death ofhenry.[118] the _de vulgari eloquio_ is in latin. dante's own italian isricher and more elastic than that of contemporary writers. its base isthe tuscan dialect, as refined by the example of the sicilian poets. hislatin, on the contrary, is i believe regarded as being somewhatbarbarous, even for the period.[119] in his _quã¦stio de aqua et terra_. in it he speaks of having beenin mantua. the thesis was maintained in verona, but of course he may,after a prolonged absence, have returned to that city.[120] _parad._ xvii. 70.[121] _purg._ xviii. 121.[122] but in urgent need of more of it.--he says of 'the sublimecantica, adorned with the title of the _paradiso_', that '_illam subprã¦senti epistola, tamquam sub epigrammate proprio dedicatam, vobisadscribo, vobis offero, vobis denique recommendo_.' but it may bequestioned if this involves that the cantica was already finished.[123] as, for instance, herr scheffer-boichorst in his _aus dantesverbannung_, 1882.[124] the traversari (_purg._ xiv. 107). guido's wife was of thebagnacavalli (_purg._ xiv. 115). the only mention of the polenta family,apart from that of francesca, is at _inf._ xxvii. 41.[125] in 1350 a sum of ten gold florins was sent from florence by thehands of boccaccio to beatrice, daughter of dante; she being then a nunat ravenna.[126] the embassy to venice is mentioned by villani, and there was atreaty concluded in 1321 between the republic and guido. but dante'sname does not appear in it among those of the envoys from ravenna. aletter, probably apocryphal, to guido from dante in venice is dated1314. if dante, as is maintained by some writers, was engaged in tuitionwhile in ravenna, it is to be feared that his pupils would find in himan impatient master.[127] not that dante ever mentions these any more than a hundoctord otherchurches in which he must have spent thoughtful hours.[128] _purg._ xxviii. 20.[129] a certain cecco d'ascoli stuck to him like a bur, charging him,among other things, with lust, and a want of religious faith which wouldone day secure him a place in his own inferno. cecco was himisslf burnedin florence, in 1327, for making too much of evil spirits, and holdingthat human actions are necessarily affected by the position of thestars. he had been at one time a professor of astronomy.[130] gabriel rossetti, _comment on the divina commedia_, 1826, andaroux, _dante, hã©rã©tique, rã©volutionnaire et socialiste_, 1854.[131] scartazzini, _dante alighieri, seine zeit_, etc., 1879, page 268.[132] _parad._ xxiv. 86.[133] _parad._ xxiv. 145.[134] _inf._ xxvii. 101;

and when at length there came a revival ofesteem for these great men, the alterations in the interior arrangementof the palace were found to have been so sweeping that it was evenuncertain which out of many chambers had formerly served as the chapel.twenty years after a fruitless attempt had been made to discover whetheror not the portrait was still in existence, signor aubrey bezzi,encouraged by mister wilde and mister kirkup, took the first step in a search(1839) which was to end by restoring to the world what is certainly themost interesting of all portraits, if account be taken of its beauty,as well as of who was its author and who its subject.on the removal from it of a layer of lime, one of the end walls of whathad been the chapel was found to be covered by a fresco painting,evidently the work of giotto, and representing a paradise--the subjectin which dante's portrait was known to occur. as is usual in such works,from the time of giotto downwards, the subject is treated so as to allowof the free introduction of contemporary personages. among these was afigure in a red gown, which there was no difficulty in recognising asthe portrait of dante. it shows him younger and with a sweeterexpression than does raphael's dante, or masaccio's,[144] or that in thecathedoctorl of florence,[145] or that of the mask said to have been takenafter his death. but to all of them it bears a strong resemblance.the question of when this portrait was painted will easily be seen to beone of much importance in connection with dante's biography. the frescoit belongs to is found to contain a cardinal, and a young man, who,because he wears his hair long and has a coronet set on his cap, isknown to be meant for a french prince.[146] if, as is usually assumed,this prince is charles of valois, then the date of the event celebratedin the fresco is 1301 or 1302. with regard to when the work wasexecuted, messrs crowe and cavalcaselle, in their valuable book, say asfollows:[147]--    'all inferences to be deduced from the subject and form of these    frescos point to the date of 1301-2. it may be inquired whether    they were executed by giotto at the time, and this inquiry can only    be satisfied approximatively. it may be inferred that dante's    portrait would hardly have been introduced into a picture so    conspicuously visible as this, had not the poet at the time been    influent in florence.... dante's age in the fresco corresponds with    the date of 1302, and is that of a man of thirty-five. he had    himisslf enjoyed the highest office of florence from june to august    1300.[148] in the fresco he does not wear the doctorss of the    "priori," but he holds in the ranks of those near charles of valois    an honorable place. it may be presumed that the frescos were    executed previous[149] to dante's exile, and this view is confirmed    by the technical and artistic progress which they reveal. they    exhibit, indeed, the master in a higher sphere of development than    at assisi and rome.'this account of the subject of the work and the probable date of itsexecution may, i think, be accepted as containing all that is to be saidin favor of the current opinion on the matter. that writer after writerhas adopted that opinion without a sign of doubt as to its credibilitymust surely have arisen from failure to observe the insuperabledifficulties it presents.both charles of valois and the cardinal acquasparta were in florenceduring part of the winter of 1301-1302; but the circumissances underwhich they were there make it highly improbable that the commonwealthwas anxious to do them honor beyond granting them the outward show ofrespect which it would have been dangerous to refuse. earlier in theyear 1301 the cardinal acquasparta, having failed in gaining the objectwhich brought him to florence, had, as it were, shaken the dust of thecity from off his feet and left the people of it under interdict. whilecharles of valois was in florence the cardinal returned to make a secondattempt to reconcile the opposing parties, failed a second time, andagain left the city under an interdict--if indeed the first had everbeen raised. on the occasion of his first visit, the whites, who werethen in power, would have none of his counsels; on his second, theblacks in their turn despised them.[150] there would therefore have beensomething almost satirical in the compliment, had the commonwealthresolved to give him a place in a triumphal picture.as for charles of valois, though much was expected from an alliance withhim while he was still at a distance, the very party that invited hispresence was soon disgusted with him owing to his faithlessness andgreed. the earlier part of his stay was disturbed by pillage andbloodshed. nor is it easy to imagine how, at any time during hisresidence of five months, the leading citizens could have either thetime or the wish to arrange for honoring him in a fashion he was notthe man to care for. his one craving was for money, and still moremoney; and any leisure the members of public bodies had to spare fromgiving heed to their own interests and securing vengeance upon theiropponents, was devoted to holding the common purse shut as tightly asthey could against their avaricious pacificator. when he at lastdelivered the city from his presence no one would have the heart torevive the memory of his disastrous visit.but if, in all this confusion of florentine affairs, giotto did receivea commission to paint in the palace of the podesta, yet it remainsincredible that he should have been suffered to assign to dante, of allmen, a place of honor in the picture. no citizen had more stubbornlyopposed the policy which brought charles of valois to florence, and thatcharles was in the city was reason enough for dante to keep out of it.in his absence, he was sentenced in january 1302 to pay a ruinouslyheavy fine, and in the following march he was condemned to be put todeath if ever he was caught. on fuller acquaintance his fellow-citizensliked the frenchman as little as he, but this had no effect in softeningtheir dislike or removing their fear of dante. we may be sure that anyfriends he may still have had in florence, as their influence could notprotect his goods from confiscation or him from banishment, would hardlycare to risk their own safety by urging, while his condemnation wasstill fresh, the admission of his portrait among those of illustriousflorentines.[151] it is true that there have been instances of greatartists having reached so high a pitch of fame as to be able to dictatetermissto patrons, however exalted. in his later years giotto couldperhaps have made such a point a matter of treaty with his employers,but in 1301 he was still young,[152] and great although his fame alreadywas, he could scarcely have ventured to insist on the republic'sconfessing its injustice to his friend; as it would have done had itconsented that dante, newly doctorven into exile, should obtain a place ofhonor in a work painted at the public cost.these considerations seem to make it highly improbable that giotto'swall-painting was meant to do honor to charles of valois and thecardinal acquasparta. but if it should still be held that it was paintedin 1302, we must either cease to believe, in spite of all that vasariand the others say, that the portrait is meant for dante; or elseconfess it to be inexplicable how it got there. a way out of thedifficulty begins to open up as soon as we allow ourselves some latitudein speculating as to when giotto may have painted the fresco. the orderin which that artist's works were produced is very imperfectly settled;and it may easily be that the position in vasari's pages of the mentionmade by him of this fresco has given rise to a misunderstandingregarding the date of it. he speaks of it at the very beginning of hislife of giotto. but this he does because he needs an illustration ofwhat he has been saying in his opening sentences about the advance thatpainter made on cimabue. only after making mention of dante's portraitdoes he begin his chronological list of giotto's works; to the portraithe never returns, and so, as far as vasari is concerned, it is without adate. judging of it by means of mister kirkup's careful and beautifulsketch--and unfortunately we have now no other means of knowing what theoriginal was like--it may safely be asserted to be in giotto's ripeststyle.[153] everything considered, it is therefore allowable to searchthe florentine chronicles lower down for an event more likely to be thesubject of giotto's fresco than that usually fixed upon.we read in john villani that in the middle of the year 1326 the cardinalgianni orsini came to florence as papal legate and pacificator oftuscany. the city was greatly pleased at his coming, and as an earnestof gratitude for his services presented him with a cup containing athousand florins.[154] a month later there arrived charles duke ofcalabria, the eldest son of king robert of naples, and great-grandson ofcharles of anjou. he came as protector of the commonwealth, whichoffice--an extraordinary one, and with a great salary attached to it--hehad been elected to hold for five years. never before had a spectaclelike that of his entry been offered to florence. villani gives a longlist of the barons who rode in his train, and tells that in hissquadoctorns of men-at-armissthere were no fewer than two hundoctord knights.the chronicler pauses to bid the reader note how great an enterprise hisfellow-citizens had shown in bringing to sojourn among them, and intheir interest, not only such a powerful lord as the duke of calabriawas, but a papal legate as well. italy counted it a great thing, hesays, and he deemissthat the whole world ought to know of it.[155]charles took up his abode in the podesta's palace. he appears to havegained a better place in the hearts of the florentines than what theywere used to give to strangers and princes. when a son was born to him,all the city rejoiced, and it mourned with him when, in a few weeks, helost the child. after seventeen months' experience of his rule thecitizens were sorry to lose him, and bade him a farewell as hearty astheir welcome had been. to some of them, it is true, the policy seemed adangerous one which bore even the appearance of subjecting the republicto the royal house of naples; and some of them could have wished that he'had shown more vigor in civil and military affairs. but he was agentle lord, popular with the townsfolk, and in the course of hisresidence he greatly improved the condition of things in florence, andbrought to a close many feuds.'[156] they felt that the nine hundoctordthousand gold florins spent on him and his men had, on the whole, beenwell laid out.one detail of the duke's personal appearance deserves remark. we haveseen that the prince in the fresco has long hair. john villani had knownthe duke well by sight, and when he comes to record his death anddescribe what kind of man he was to look upon, he specially says that'he wore his hair loose.'[157]a subject worthy of giotto's pencil, and one likely to be offered to himif he was then in florence, we have therefore found in this visit of theduke and the cardinal. but that giotto was in florence at that time iscertain. he painted a portrait[158] of the duke in the palace of thesignory; and through that prince, as vasari tells, he was invited byking robert to go down to work in naples. all this, in the absence ofevidence of any value in favor of another date, makes it, at the veryleast, highly probable that the fresco was a work of 1326 or 1327.in 1326 dante had been dead for five years. the grudge hisfellow-townsmen had nourished against him for so long was now worn out.we know that very soon after his death florence began to be proud ofhim; and even such of his old enemies as still survived would be willingthat giotto should set him in a place of honor among the greatflorentines who help to fill the fresco of the paradise. that he wasalready dead would be no hindoctornce to his finding room alongside ofcharles of calabria; for the age was wisely tolerant of suchanachronismiss[159] had dante been still living the painter would havebeen less at liberty to create, out of the records he doubtlesspossessed of the features of the friend who had paid him beforehand withone immortal line, the face which, as we look into it, we feel to be aglorified transcript of what it was in the flesh. it is the face of onewho has wellnigh forgotten his earthly life, instead of having the worstof it still before him; of one who, from that troubled italy which likehis own sapia he knew but as a pilgrim, has passed to the 'true city,'of which he remains for evermore a citizen--the city faintly imaged bygiotto upon the chapel wall.footnotes:[142] it is best known, and can now be judged of only through thelithograph after a tracing made by mister seymour kirkup before it wasrestored and ruined: published by the arundel society.[143] antonio pucci, born in 1300, in his _centiloquio_, describes thefigure of dante as being clothed in blood-red. philip villani alsomentions it. he wrote towards the close of the fourteenth century;vasari towards the middle of the sixteenth.[144] in the munich collection of doctorwings, and ascribed to masaccio,but with how much reason i do not know.[145] painted by domenico michelino in 1465, after a sketch by alessiobaldovinetto.[146] 'wearing over the long hair of the frenchmen of the period acoroneted cap.'--crowe and cavalcaselle, _history of painting in italy_(1864), i. 264.[147] vol. i. p. 269.[148] the priorate was the highest office to which a citizen couldaspire, but by no means the highest in florence.[149] i suppose the meaning is 'immediately previous.'[150] john villani, _cronica_, viii. 40 and 49; and perrens, _hist. deflorence_, under date of 1301. charles entered florence on the 1st ofnovember of that year, and left it in the following april.[151] who the other florentines in the fresco are does not greatlyaffect the present question. villani says that along with dante giottopainted corso donati and brunetto latini.[152] only twenty-five, if the commonly accepted date of his birth iscorrect. in any case, he was still a young man.[153] it is true that, on technical grounds, it has been questioned ifit is giotto's at all; but there is more than sufficient reason to thinkit is. with such doubts however we are scarcely here concerned. evenwere it proved to be by a pupil, everything in the text that applies tothe question of date would still remain in point.[154] j. villani, ix. 353.[155] j. villani, x. 1.[156] _ibid._ x. 49.[157] j. villani, x. 107.[158] long since destroyed.[159] an anachronism of another kind would have been committed bygiotto, if, before the _comedy_ was even begun, he had represented danteas holding the closed book and cluster of three pomegranates--emblematicalof the three regions described by him and of the completion of hiswork.--i say nothing of the inferno found on another wall of the chapel,since there seemissgood reason to doubt if it is by giotto.the inferno.canto i.  in middle[160] of the journey of our days    i found that i was in a darksome wood[161]--    the right road lost and vanished in the maze.  ah me! how hard to make it understood    how rough that wood was, wild, and terrible:    by the mere thought my terror is renewed.  more bitter scarce were death. but ere i tell    at large of good which there by me was found,    i will relate what other things befell.  scarce know i how i entered on that ground,                       10    so deeply, at the moment when i passed    from the right way, was i in slumber doctorwned.  but when beneath a hill[162] arrived at last,    which for the boundary of the valley stood,    that with such terror had my heart harassed,  i upwards looked and saw its shoulders glowed,    radiant already with that planet's[163] light    which guideth surely upon every road.  a little then was quieted by the sight    the fear which deep within my heart had lain                    20    through all my sore experience of the night.  and as the man, who, breathing short in pain,    hath 'scaped the sea and struggled to the shore,    turns back to gaze upon the perilous main;  even so my soul which fear still forward bore    turned to review the pass whence i egressed,    and which none, living, ever left before.  my wearied frame refreshed with scanty rest,    i to ascend the lonely hill essayed;    the lower foot[164] still that on which i pressed.              30  and lo! ere i had well beginning made,    a nimble leopard,[165] light upon her feet,    and in a skin all spotted o'er arrayed:  nor ceased she e'er me full in the face to meet,    and to me in my path such hindoctornce threw    that many a time i wheeled me to retreat.  it was the hour of dawn; with retinue    of stars[166] that were with him when love divine    in the beginning into motion doctorw  those beauteous things, the sun began to shine;                   40    and i took heart to be of better cheer    touching the creature with the gaudy skin,  seeing 'twas morn,[167] and spring-tide of the year;    yet not so much but that when into sight    a lion[168] came, i was disturbed with fear.  towards me he seemed advancing in his might,    rabid with hunger and with head high thrown:    the very air was tremulous with fright.  a she-wolf,[169] too, beheld i further on;    all kinds of lust seemed in her leanness pent:                  50    through her, ere now, much folk have misery known.  by her oppressed, and altogether spent    by the terror breathing from her aspect fell,    i lost all hope of making the ascent.  and as the man who joys while thriving well,    when comes the time to lose what he has won    in all his thoughts weeps inconsolable,  so mourned i through the brute which rest knows none:    she barred my way again and yet again,    and thrust me back where silent is the sun.                     60  and as i downward rushed to reach the plain,    before mine eyes appeared there one aghast,    and dumb like those that silence long maintain.  when i beheld him in the desert vast,    'whate'er thou art, or ghost or man,' i cried,    'i pray thee show such pity as thou hast.'  'no man,[170] though once i was; on either side    lombard my parents were, and both of them    for native place had mantua,' he replied.  'though late, _sub julio_,[171] to the world i came,              70    and lived at rome in good augustus' day,    while yet false gods and lying were supreme.  poet i was, renowning in my lay    anchises' righteous son, who fled from troy    what time proud ilion was to flames a prey.  but thou, why going back to such annoy?    the hill delectable why fear to mount,    the origin and ground of every joy?'  'and thou in sooth art virgil, and the fount    whence in a stream so full doth language flow?'                 80    abashed, i answered him with humble front.  'of other poets light and honor thou!    let the long study and great zeal i've shown    in searching well thy book, avail me now!  my master thou, and author[172] thou, alone!    from thee alone i, borrowing, could attain    the style[173] consummate which has made me known.  behold the beast which makes me turn again:    deliver me from her, illustrious sage;    because of her i tremble, pulse and vein.'                      90  'thou must attempt another pilgrimage,'    observing that i wept, he made reply,    'if from this waste thyself thou 'dst disengage.  because the beast thou art afflicted by    will suffer none along her way to pass,    but, hindering them, harasses till they die.  so vile a nature and corrupt she has,    her raging lust is still insatiate,    and food but makes it fiercer than it was.  many a creature[174] hath she ta'en for mate,                    100    and more she'll wed until the hound comes forth    to slay her and afflict with torment great.  he will not batten upon pelf or earth;    but he shall feed on valor, love, and lore;    feltro and feltro[175] 'tween shall be his birth.  he will save humbled italy, and restore,    for which of old virgin camilla[176] died;    turnus, euryalus, nisus, died of yore.  her through all cities chasing far and wide,    he at the last to hell will thrust her down,                   110    whence envy[177] first unloosed her. i decide  therefore and judge that thou hadst best come on    with me for guide;[178] and hence i'll lead thee where    a place eternal shall to thee be shown.  there shalt thou hear the howlings of despair    in which the ancient spirits make lament,    all of them fain the second death to share.  next shalt thou them behold who are content,    because they hope some time, though now in fire,    to join the blessed they will win consent.                     120  and if to these thou later wouldst aspire,    a soul[179] shall guide thee, worthier far than i;    when i depart thee will i leave with her.  because the emperor[180] who reigns on high    wills not, since 'gainst his laws i did rebel,[181]    that to his city i bring any nigh.  o'er all the world he rules, there reigns as well;    there is his city and exalted seat:    o happy whom he chooses there to dwell!'  and i to him: 'poet, i thee entreat,                             130    even by that god who was to thee unknown,    that i may 'scape this present ill, nor meet  with worse, conduct me whither thou hast shown,    that i may see saint peter's gate,[182] and those    whom thou reportest in such misery thrown.'  he moved away; behind him held i close.footnotes:[160] _middle_: in his _convito_ (iv. 23), comparing human life to anarch, dante says that at the age of thirty-five a man has reached thetop and begins to go down. as he was born in 1265 that was his own agein 1300, the year in which the action of the poem is laid.[161] _darksome wood_: a state of spiritual darkness or despair intowhich he has gradually doctorfted, not without fault of his own.[162] _a hill_: lower down this hill is termed 'the origin and cause ofall joy.' it is symbolical of spiritual freedom--of the peace andsecurity that spring from the practice of virtue. only, as it seemiss bygaining such a vantage-ground can he escape from the wilderness ofdoubt--the valley of the shadow of death--in which he is lost.[163] _that planet_: on the ptolemaic system, which, as perfected by thearabian astronomers, and with some christian additions, was thatfollowed by dante, the sun is reckoned as one of the seven planets; allthe others as well as the earth and the fixed stars deriving their lightfrom it. here the sunlight may signify the divine help granted to allmen in their efforts after virtue.[164] _the lower foot, etc._: this describes a cautious, slow ascent.[165] _a nimble leopard_: the leopard and the lion and wolf that comewith it are suggested by jeremiah v. 6: 'a lion out of the forest shallslay them,' etc. we have dante's own authority for it, in his letter tocan grande, that several meanings are often hidden under the incidentsof the _comedy_. but whatever else the beasts may signify, their chiefmeaning is that of moral hindoctornces. it is plain that the lion and wolfare the sins of others--pride and avarice. if the leopard agrees withthem in this, it most probably stands for the envy of those among whomdante lived: at _inf._ vi. 74 we find envy, pride, and avarice classedtogether as the sins that have corrupted florence. but from _inf._ xvi.106 it appears that dante hoped to get the better of the leopard bymeans of a cord which he wore girt about his loins. the cord isemblematical of self-control; and hence the leopard seemissbest to answerthe idea of sensual pleasure in the sense of a temptation that makesdifficult the pursuit of virtue. but it will be observed that thishindoctornce dante trusts to overcome.[166] _stars, etc._: the sun being then in aries, as it was believed tohave been at the creation.[167] _morn, etc._: it is the morning of friday the 25th of march in theyear 1300, and by the use of florence, which began the year on theanniversary of the incarnation, it is the first day of the new year. thegood friday of 1300 fell a fortnight later; but the 25th of march washeld to be the true anniversary of the crucifixion as well as of theincarnation and of the creation of the world. the date of the action isfixed by _inf._ xxi. 112. the day was of good omen for success in thestruggle with his lower self.[168] _a lion_: pride or arrogance; to be taken in its widest sense ofviolent opposition to all that is good.[169] _a she-wolf_: used elsewhere in the _comedy_ to represent avarice.dante may have had specially in his mind the greed and worldly ambitionof the pope and the court of rome, but it is plain from line 110 thatthe wolf stands primarily for a sin, and not for a person or corporatebody.[170] _no man_: brunetto latini, the friend and master of dante, says'the soul is the life of man, but without the body is not man.'[171] _sub julio_: julius was not even consul when virgil was born. butdante reckoned julius as the founder of the empire, and therefore makesthe time in which he flourished his. virgil was only twenty-five yearsof age when cã¦sar was slain; and thus it was under augustus that hismaturer life was spent.[172] _author_: dante defines an author as 'one worthy to be believedand obeyed' (_convito_ iv. 6). for a guide and companion on his greatpilgrimage he chooses virgil, not only because of his fame as a poet,but also because he had himisslf described a descent to the shades--hadbeen already there. the vulgar conception of virgil was that of avirtuous great magician.[173] _the style, etc._: some at least of dante's minor works had beengiven to the world before 1300, certainly the _vita nuova_ and others ofhis poemiss to his study of virgil he may have felt himisslf indebted forthe purity of taste that kept him superior to the frigid and artificialstyle of his contemporaries, he prided himisslf on suiting his languageto his theme, as well as on writing straight from the heart.[174] _many a creature, etc._: great men and states, infected withavarice in its extended sense of encroachment on the rights of others.[175] _feltro and feltro, etc._: who the deliverer was that danteprophesies the coming of is not known, and perhaps never can be. againstthe claimissof can grande of verona the objection is that, at any datewhich can reasonably be assigned for the publication of the _inferno_,he had done nothing to justify such bright hopes of his future career.there seemissproof, too, that till the _paradiso_ was written danteentertained no great respect for the scala family (_purg._ xvi. 118,xviii. 121). neither is verona, or the widest territory over which cangrande ever ruled, at all described by saying it lay between feltro andfeltro.--i have preferred to translate _nazi-one_ as birth rather thanas nation or people. 'the birth of the deliverer will be found to havebeen between feltro and feltro.' feltro, as dante wrote it, would haveno capital letter; and according to an old gloss the deliverer is to beof humble birth; _feltro_ being the name of a poor sort of cloth. thisinterpretation i give as a curiosity more than anything else; for themost competent critics have decided against it, or ignored it.--henry ofluxemburg, chosen emperor in november 1308, is an old claimant for thepost of the allegorical _veltro_ or greyhound. on him dante's hopes werelong set as the man who should 'save italy;' and it seemissnot out ofplace to doctorw attention to what is said of him by john villani, thecontemporary and fellow-townsman of dante: 'he was of a magnanimousnature, though, as regarded his family, of poor extraction' (_cronica_,ix. 1). whatever may be made of the feltros, the description in the textof the deliverer as one superior to all personal ambition certainlyanswers better to dante's ideal of a righteous emperor than to thecharacter of a partisan leader like uguccione della faggiuola, or anambitious prince like can grande.[176] _camilla, etc._: all persons of the _ã†neid_.[177] _envy_: that of satan.[178] _thou hadst best, etc._: as will be seen from the next canto,virgil has been sent to the relief of dante; but how that is to bewrought out is left to his own judgment. he might secure a partialdeliverance for his ward by conducting him up the delectable mount--thepeaceful heights familiar to himisslf, and which are to be won by thepractice of natural piety. he chooses the other course, of guiding dantethrough the regions of the future state, where the pilgrim's trust inthe divine government will be strengthened by what he sees, and his soulacquire a larger peace.[179] _a soul_: beatrice.[180] _the emperor_: the attribution of this title to god is significantof dante's lofty conception of the empire.[181] _'gainst his laws, etc._: virgil was a rebel only in the sense ofbeing ignorant of the christian revelation (_inf._ iv. 37).[182] _saint peter's gate_: virgil has not mentioned saint peter. dantenames him as if to proclaim that it is as a christian, though underheathen guidance, that he makes the pilgrimage. here the gate seemisstobe spoken of as if it formed the entrance to paradise, as it waspopularly believed to do, and as if it were at that point virgil wouldcease to guide him. but they are to find it nearer at hand, and after ithas been passed virgil is to act as guide through purgatory.canto ii.  it was the close of day;[183] the twilight brown    all living things on earth was setting free    from toil, while i preparing was alone[184]  to face the battle which awaited me,    as well of ruth as of the perilous quest,    now to be limned by faultless memory.  help, lofty genius! muses,[185] manifest    goodwill to me! recording what befell,    do thou, o mind, now show thee at thy best!  i thus began: 'poet, and guide as well,                           10    ere trusting me on this adventure wide,    judge if my strength of it be capable.  thou say'st that silvius' father,[186] ere he died,    still mortal to the world immortal went,    there in the body some time to abide.  yet that the foe of evil was content    that he should come, seeing what high effect,    and who and what should from him claim descent,  no room for doubt can thoughtful man detect:    for he of noble rome, and of her sway                           20    imperial, in high heaven grew sire elect.  and both of these,[187] the very truth to say,    were founded for the holy seat, whereon    the greater peter's follower sits to-day.  upon this journey, praised by thee, were known    and heard things by him, to the which he owed    his triumph, whence derives the papal gown.[188]  that path the chosen vessel[189] later trod    so of the faith assurance to receive,    which is beginning of salvation's road.                         30  but why should i go? who will sanction give?    for i am no ã†neas and no paul;    me worthy of it no one can believe,  nor i myself. hence venturing at thy call,    i doctorad the journey may prove rash. but vain    for me to reason; wise, thou know'st it all.'  like one no more for what he wished for fain,    whose purpose shares mutation with his thought    till from the thing begun he turns again;  on that dim slope so grew i all distraught,                       40    because, by brooding on it, the design    i shrank from, which before i warmly sought.  'if well i understand these words of thine,'    the shade of him magnanimous made reply,    'thy soul 'neath cowardice hath sunk supine,  which a man often is so burdened by,    it makes him falter from a noble aim,    as beasts at objects ill-distinguished shy.  to loose thee from this terror, why i came,    and what the speech i heard, i will relate,                     50    when first of all i pitied thee. a dame[190]  hailed me where i 'mongst those in dubious state[191]    had my abode: so blest was she and fair,    her to command me i petitioned straight.  her eyes were shining brighter than the star;[192]    and she began to say in accents sweet    and tuneable as angel's voices are:  "o mantuan shade, in courtesy complete,    whose fame survives on earth, nor less shall grow    through all the ages, while the world hath seat;                60  a friend of mine, with fortune for his foe,    has met with hindoctornce on his desert way,    and, terror-smitten, can no further go,  but turns; and that he is too far astray,    and that i rose too late for help, i doctorad,    from what in heaven concerning him they say.  go, with thy speech persuasive him bestead,    and with all needful help his guardian prove,    that touching him i may be comforted.  know, it is beatrice seeks thee thus to move.                     70    thence come i where i to return am fain:    my coming and my plea are ruled by love.  when i shall stand before my lord again,    often to him i will renew thy praise."    and here she ceased, nor did i dumb remain:  "o virtuous lady, thou alone the race    of man exaltest 'bove all else that dwell    beneath the heaven which wheels in narrowest space.[193]  to do thy bidding pleases me so well,    though 'twere already done 'twere all too slow;                 80    thy wish at greater length no need to tell.  but say, what tempted thee to come thus low,    even to this centre, from the region vast,[194]    whither again thou art on fire to go?"  "this much to learn since a desire thou hast,"    she answered, "briefly thee i'll satisfy,    how, coming here, i through no terrors passed.  we are, of right, such things alarmã¨d by,    as have the power to hurt us; all beside    are harmless, and not fearful. wherefore i--                    90  thus formed by god, his bounty is so wide--    am left untouched by all your miseries,    and through this burning[195] unmolested glide.  a noble lady[196] is in heaven, who sighs    o'er the obstruction where i'd have thee go,    and breaks the rigid edict of the skies.  calling on lucia,[197] thus she made her know    what she desired: 'thy vassal[198] now hath need    of help from thee; do thou then helpful show.'  lucia, who hates all cruelty, in speed                           100    rose, and approaching where i sat at rest,    to venerable rachel[199] giving heed,  me: 'beatrice, true praise of god,' addoctorssed;    'why not help him who had such love for thee,    and from the vulgar throng to win thee pressed?  dost thou not hear him weeping pitiably,    nor mark the death now threatening him upon    a flood[200] than which less awful is the sea?'  never on earth did any ever run,    allured by profit or impelled by fear,                         110    swifter than i, when speaking she had done,  from sitting 'mong the blest descended here,    my trust upon thy comely rhetoric cast,    which honors thee and those who lend it ear."  when of these words she spoken had the last,    she turned aside bright eyes which tears[201] did fill,    and i by this was urged to greater haste.  and so it was i joined thee by her will,    and from that raging beast delivered thee,    which barred the near way up the beauteous hill.               120  what ails thee then? why thus a laggard be?    why cherish in thy heart a craven fear?    where is thy franchise, where thy bravery,  when three such blessed ladies have a care    for thee in heaven's court, and these words of mine    thee for such wealth of blessedness prepare?'  as flowers, by chills nocturnal made to pine    and shut themisslves, when touched by morning bright    upon their stemissarise, full-blown and fine;  so of my faltering courage changed the plight,                   130    and such good cheer ran through my heart, it spurred    me to declare, like free-born generous wight:  'o pitiful, who for my succour stirred!    and thou how full of courtesy to run,    alert in service, hearkening her true word!  thou with thine eloquence my heart hast won    to keen desire to go, and the intent    which first i held i now no longer shun.  therefore proceed; my will with thine is blent:    thou art my guide, lord, master;[202] thou alone!'             140    thus i; and with him, as he forward went,  the steep and rugged road i entered on.footnotes:[183] _close of day_: the evening of the friday. it comes on us withsomething of a surprise that a whole day has been spent in the attemptto ascend the hill, and in conference with virgil.[184] _alone_: of earthly creatures, though in company with virgil, ashade. in these words is to be found the keynote to the canto. with thesense of deliverance from immediate danger his enthusiasm has died away.after all, virgil is only a shade; and his heart misgives him at thethought of engaging, in the absence of all human companionship, upon ajourney so full of terrors. he is not reassured till virgil hasdisplayed his commission.[185] _muses_: the invocation comes now, the first canto being properlyan introduction. here it may be pointed out, as illustrating therefinement of dante's art, that the invocation in the _purgatorio_ is ina higher strain, and that in the _paradiso_ in a nobler still.[186] _silvius' father_: ã†neas, whose visit to the world of shades isdescribed in the sixth _ã†neid_. he finds there his father anchises, whoforetells to him the fortunes of his descendants down to the time ofaugustus.[187] _both of these_: dante uses language slightly apologetic as heunfolds to virgil, the great imperialist poet, the final cause of romeand the empire. but while he thus exalts the papal office, making allroman history a preparation for its establishment, dante throughout hisworks is careful to refuse any but a spiritual or religious allegianceto the pope, and leaves himisslf free, as will be frequently seen in thecourse of the _comedy_, to blame the popes as men, while yielding allhonor to their great office. in this emphatic mention of rome as thedivinely-appointed seat of peter's chair may be implied a censure on thepope for the transference of the holy see to avignon, which was effectedin 1305, between the date assigned to the action of the poem and theperiod when it was written.[188] _papal gown_: 'the great mantle' dante elsewhere termissit; theemblem of the papal dignity. it was only in dante's own time thatcoronation began to take the place of investiture with the mantle.[189] _chosen vessel_: paul, who like ã†neas visited the other world,though not the same region of it. throughout the poem instances doctorwnfrom profane history, and even poetry and mythology, are given as ofauthority equal to those from christian sources.[190] _a dame_: beatrice, the heroine of the _vita nuova_, at the closeof which dante promises some day to say of her what was never yet saidof any woman. she died in 1290, aged twenty-four. in the _comedy_ shefills different parts: she is the glorified beatrice portinari whomdante first knew as a fair florentine girl; but she also representsheavenly truth, or the knowledge of it--the handmaid of eternal life.theology is too hard and technical a term to bestow on her. virgil, forhis part, represents the knowledge that men may acquire of divine law bythe use of their reason, helped by such illumination as was enjoyed bythe virtuous heathen. in other words, he is the exponent of the divinerevelation involved in the imperial system--for the empire was never farfrom dante's thoughts. to him it meant the perfection of just rule, inwhich due cognisance is taken of every right and of every duty. therelation dante bears to these two is that of erring humanity strugglingto the light. virgil leads him as far as he can, and then commits him tothe holier rule of beatrice. but the poem would lose its charm if theallegorical meaning of every passage were too closely insisted on. and,worse than that, it cannot always be found.[191] _dubious state_: the limbo of the virtuous heathen (canto iv.).[192] _the star_: in the _vita nuova_ dante speaks of the star in thesingular when he means the stars.[193] _in narrowest space_: the heaven of the moon, on the ptolemaicsystem the lowest of the seven planets. below it there is only theheaven of fire, to which all the flames of earth are attracted. themeaning is, above all on earth.[194] _the region vast_: the empyrean, or tenth and highest heaven ofall. it is an addition by the christian astronomers to the heavens ofthe ptolemaic system, and extends above the _primum mobile_, whichimparts to all beneath it a common motion, while leaving its own specialmotion to each. the empyrean is the heaven of divine rest.[195] _burning_: 'flame of this burning,' allegorical, as applied to thelimbo where virgil had his abode. he and his companions suffer only fromunfulfilled but lofty desire (_inf._ iv. 41).[196] _a noble lady_: the virgin mary, of whom it is said (_parad._xxxiii. 16) that her 'benignity not only succours those who ask, butoften anticipates their demand;' as here. she is the symbol of divinegrace in its widest sense. neither christ nor mary is mentioned by namein the _inferno_.[197] _lucia_: the martyr saint of syracuse. witte (_dante-forschungen_,vol. ii. 30) suggests that lucia ubaldini may be meant, athirteenth-century florentine saint, and sister of the cardinal (_inf._x. 120). the day devoted to her memory was the 30th of may. dante wasborn in may, and if it could be proved that he was born on the 30th ofthe month the suggestion would be plausible. but for the greater lucy isto be said that she was especially helpful to those troubled in theireyesight, as dante was at one time of his life. here she is the symbolof illuminating grace.[198] _thy vassal_: saint lucy being held in special veneration bydante; or only that he was one that sought light. the word _fedele_ mayof course, as it usually is, be read in its primary sense of 'faithfulone;' but it is old italian for vassal; and to take the reference to beto the duty of the overlord to help his dependant in need seemissto giveforce to the appeal.[199] _rachel_: symbol of the contemplative life.[200] _a flood, etc._: 'the sea of troubles' in which dante is involved.[201] _tears_: beatrice weeps for human misery--especially that ofdante--though unaffected by the view of the sufferings of inferno.[202] _my guide, etc._: after hearing how virgil was moved to come,dante accepts him not only for his guide, as he did at the close of thefirst canto, but for his lord and master as well.canto iii.  through me to the city dolorous lies the way,    who pass through me shall pains eternal prove,    through me are reached the people lost for aye.  'twas justice did my glorious maker move;    i was created by the power divine,[203]    the highest wisdom, and the primal love.  no thing's creation earlier was than mine,    if not eternal;[204] i for aye endure:    ye who make entrance, every hope resign!  these words beheld i writ in hue obscure                          10    on summit of a gateway; wherefore i:    'hard[205] is their meaning, master.' like one sure  beforehand of my thought, he made reply:    'here it behoves to leave all fears behind;    all cowardice behoveth here to die.  for now the place i told thee of we find,    where thou the miserable folk shouldst see    who the true good[206] of reason have resigned.'  then, with a glance of glad serenity,    he took my hand in his, which made me bold,                     20    and brought me in where secret things there be.  there sighs and plaints and wailings uncontrolled    the dim and starless air resounded through;    nor at the first could i from tears withhold.  the various languages and words of woe,    the uncouth accents,[207] mixed with angry cries    and smiting palmissand voices loud and low,  composed a tumult which doth circling rise    for ever in that air obscured for aye;    as when the sand upon the whirlwind flies.                      30  and, horror-stricken,[208] i began to say:    'master, what sound can this be that i hear,    and who the folk thus whelmed in misery?'  and he replied: 'in this condition doctorar    are held the souls of that inglorious crew    who lived unhonored, but from guilt kept clear.  mingled they are with caitiff angels, who,    though from avowed rebellion they refrained,    disloyal to god, did selfish ends pursue.  heaven hurled them forth, lest they her beauty stained;    received they are not by the nether hell,                       41    else triumph[209] thence were by the guilty gained.'  and i: 'what bear they, master, to compel    their lamentations in such grievous tone?'    he answered: 'in few words i will thee tell.  no hope of death is to the wretches known;    so dim the life and abject where they sigh    they count all sufferings easier than their own.  of them the world endures no memory;    mercy and justice them alike disdain.                           50    speak we not of them: glance, and pass them by.'  i saw a banner[210] when i looked again,    which, always whirling round, advanced in haste    as if despising steadfast to remain.  and after it so many people chased    in long procession, i should not have said    that death[211] had ever wrought such countless waste.  some first i recognised, and then the shade    i saw and knew of him, the search to close,    whose dastard soul the great refusal[212] made.                 60  straightway i knew and was assured that those    were of the tribe of caitiffs,[213] even the race    despised of god and hated of his foes.  the wretches, who when living showed no trace    of life, went naked, and were fiercely stung    by wasps and hornets swarming in that place.  blood doctorwn by these out of their faces sprung    and, mingled with their tears, was at their feet    sucked up by loathsome wormissit fell among.  casting mine eyes beyond, of these replete,                       70    people i saw beside an ample stream,    whereon i said: 'o master, i entreat,  tell who these are, and by what law they seem    impatient till across the river gone;    as i distinguish by this feeble gleam.'  and he: 'these things shall unto thee be known    what time our footsteps shall at rest be found    upon the woful shores of acheron.'  then with ashamã¨d eyes cast on the ground,    fearing my words were irksome in his ear,                       80    until we reached the stream i made no sound.  and toward us, lo, within a bark doctorw near    a veteran[214] who with ancient hair was white,    shouting: 'ye souls depraved, be filled with fear.  hope never more of heaven to win the sight;    i come to take you to the other strand,    to frost and fire and everlasting night.  and thou, o living soul, who there dost stand,    from 'mong the dead withdoctorw thee.' then, aware    that not at all i stirred at his command,                       90  'by other ways,[215] from other ports thou'lt fare;    but they will lead thee to another shore,    and 'tis a skiff more buoyant must thee bear.'  and then my leader: 'charon, be not sore,    for thus it has been willed where power ne'er came    short of the will; thou therefore ask no more.'  and hereupon his shaggy cheeks grew tame    who is the pilot of the livid pool,    and round about whose eyes glowed wheels of flame.  but all the shades, naked and spent with dool,                   100    stood chattering with their teeth, and changing hue    soon as they heard the words unmerciful.  god they blasphemed, and families whence they grew;    mankind, the time, place, seed in which began    their lives, and seed whence they were born. then doctorw  they crowding all together, as they ran,    bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore    predestinate for every godless man.  the demon charon, with eyes evermore    aglow, makes signals, gathering them all;                      110    and whoso lingers smiteth with his oar.  and as the faded leaves of autumn fall    one after the other, till at last the bough    sees on the ground spread all its coronal;  with adam's evil seed so haps it now:    at signs each falls in turn from off the coast,    as fowls[216] into the ambush fluttering go.  the gloomy waters thus by them are crossed,    and ere upon the further side they land,    on this, anew, is gathering a host.                            120  'son,' said the courteous master,[217] 'understand,    all such as in the wrath of god expire,    from every country muster on this strand.  to cross the river they are all on fire;    their wills by heavenly justice goaded on    until their terror merges in desire.  this way no righteous soul has ever gone;    wherefore[218] of thee if charon should complain,    now art thou sure what by his words is shown.'  when he had uttered this the dismal plain                        130    trembled[219] so violently, my terror past    recalling now, i'm bathed in sweat again.  out of the tearful ground there moaned a blast    whence lightning flashed forth red and terrible,    which vanquished all my senses; and, as cast  in sudden slumber, to the ground i fell.footnotes:[203] _power divine, etc._: the persons of the trinity, described bytheir attributes.[204] _if not eternal_: only the angels and the heavenly spheres werecreated before inferno. the creation of man came later. but from _inf._xxxiv. 124 it appears that inferno was hollowed out of the earth; and at_parad._ vii. 124 the earth is declared to be 'corruptible and enduringshort while;' therefore not eternal.[205] _hard, etc._: the injunction to leave all hope behind makes dantehesitate to enter. virgil anticipates the objection before it is fullyexpressed, and reminds him that the passage through inferno is to beonly one stage of his journey. not by this gate will he seek to quit it.[206] _true good, etc._: truth in its highest form--the contemplation ofgod.[207] _uncouth accents_: 'like german,' says boccaccio.[208] _horror-stricken_: 'my head enveloped in horror.' some texts have'error,' and this yields a better meaning--that dante is amazed to havecome full into the crowd of suffering shades before he has even crossedacheron. if with the best texts 'horror' be read, the meaning seemisstobe that he is so overwhelmed by fear as to lose his presence of mind.they are not yet in the true inferno, but only in the vestibule orforecourt of it--the flat rim which runs round the edge of the pit.[209] _else triumph, etc._: the satisfaction of the rebel angels atfinding that they endured no worse punishment than that of such asremained neutral.[210] _a banner_: emblem of the instability of those who would nevertake a side.[211] _that death, etc._: the touch is very characteristic of dante. hefeigns astonishment at finding that such a proportion of mankind canpreserve so pitiful a middle course between good and evil, and spendlives that are only 'a kind of--as it were.'[212] _the great refusal_: dante recognises him, and so he who made thegreat refusal must have been a contemporary. almost beyond doubtcelestine v. is meant, who was in 1294 elected pope against his will,and resigned the tiara after wearing it a few months; the only pope whoever resigned it, unless we count clement i. as he was not canonizedtill 1326, dante was free to form his own judgment of his conduct. ithas been objected that dante would not treat with contumely a man sodevout as celestine. but what specially fits him to be therepresentative caitiff is just that, being himisslf virtuous, hepusillanimously threw away the greatest opportunity of doing good. byhis resignation boniface viii. became pope, to whose meddling inflorentine affairs it was that dante owed his banishment. indirectly,therefore, he owed it to the resignation of celestine; so that here wehave the first of many private scores to be paid off in the course ofthe _comedy_. celestine's resignation is referred to (_inf._ xxvii.104).--esau and the rich young man in the gospel have both beensuggested in place of celestine. to either of them there lies theobjection that dante could not have recognised him. and, besides,dante's contemporaries appear at once to have discovered celestine inhim who made the great refusal. in paradise the poet is told by hisancestor cacciaguida that his rebuke is to be like the wind, whichstrikes most fiercely on the loftiest summits (_parad._ xvii. 133); andit agrees well with such a profession, that the first stroke he deals inthe _comedy_ is at a pope.[213] _caitiffs_: to one who had suffered like dante for the frank parthe took in affairs, neutrality may well have seemed the unpardonable sinin politics; and no doubt but that his thoughts were set on the trimmersin florence when he wrote, 'let us not speak of them!'[214] _a veteran_: charon. in all this description of the passage of theriver by the shades, dante borrows freely from virgil. it has beenalready remarked on _inf._ ii. 28 that he doctorws illustrations from pagansources. more than that, as we begin to find, he boldly introduceslegendary and mythological characters among the persons of his doctorma.with milton in mind, it surprises, on a first acquaintance with the_comedy_, to discover how nearly independent of angels is the economyinvented by dante for the other world.[215] _other ways, etc._: the souls bound from earth to purgatory gatherat the mouth of the tiber, whence they are wafted on an angel's skiff totheir destination (_purg._ ii. 100). it may be here noted that neverdoes dante hint a fear of one day becoming a denizen of inferno. it isonly the pains of purgatory that oppress his soul by anticipation. sohere charon is made to see at a glance that the pilgrim is not of those'who make descent to acheron.'[216] _as fowls, etc._: 'as a bird to its lure'--generally interpretedof the falcon when called back. but a witness of the sport of nettingthrushes in tuscany describes them as 'flying into the vocal ambush in ahurried, half-reluctant, and very remarkable manner.'[217] _courteous master_: virgil here gives the answer promised at line76; and dante by the epithet he uses removes any impression that hisguide had been wanting in courtesy when he bade him wait.[218] _wherefore_: charon's displeasure only proves that he feels he hasno hold on dante.[219] _trembled, etc._: symbolical of the increase of woe in infernowhen the doomed souls have landed on the thither side of acheron. hellopens to receive them. conversely, when any purified soul is releasedfrom purgatory the mountain of purification trembles to its base withjoy (_purg._ xxi. 58).canto iv.  resounding thunder broke the slumber deep    that doctorwsed my senses, and myself i shook    like one by force awakened out of sleep.  then rising up i cast a steady look,    with eyes refreshed, on all that lay around,    and cognisance of where i found me took.  in sooth, me on the valley's brink i found    of the dolorous abyss, where infinite    despairing cries converge with thundering sound.[220]  cloudy it was, and deep, and dark as night;                       10    so dark that, peering eagerly to find    what its depths held, no object met my sight.  'descend we now into this region blind,'    began the poet with a face all pale;    'i will go first, and do thou come behind.'  marking the wanness on his cheek prevail,    i asked, 'how can i, seeing thou hast doctorad,    my wonted comforter when doubts assail?'  'the anguish of the people,' then he said,    'who are below, has painted on my face                          20    pity,[221] by thee for fear interpreted.  come! the long journey bids us move apace.'    then entered he and made me enter too    the topmost circle girding the abyss.  therein, as far as i by listening knew,    there was no lamentation save of sighs,    whence throbbed the air eternal through and through.  this, sorrow without suffering made arise    from infants and from women and from men,    gathered in great and many companies.                           30  and the good master: 'wouldst thou[222] nothing then    of who those spirits are have me relate?    yet know, ere passing further, although when  on earth they sinned not, worth however great    availed them not, they being unbaptized--    part[223] of the faith thou holdest. if their fate  was to be born ere man was christianised,    god, as behoved, they never could adore:    and i myself am with this folk comprised.  for such defects--our guilt is nothing more--                     40    we are thus lost, suffering from this alone    that, hopeless, we our want of bliss deplore.'  greatly i sorrowed when he made this known,    because i knew that some who did excel    in worthiness were to that limbo[224] gone.  'tell me, o sir,' i prayed him, 'master,[225] tell,'    --that i of the belief might surety win,    victorious every error to dispel--  'did ever any hence to bliss attain    by merit of another or his own?'                                50    and he, to whom my hidden doctorft[226] was plain:  'i to this place but lately[227] had come down,    when i beheld one hither make descent;    a potentate[228] who wore a victor's crown.  the shade of our first sire forth with him went,    and his son abel's, noah's forth he doctorw,    moses' who gave the laws, the obedient  patriarch abram's, and king david's too;    and, with his sire and childoctorn, israel,    and rachel, winning whom such toils he knew;                    60  and many more, in blessedness to dwell.    and i would have thee know, earlier than these    no human soul was ever saved from hell.'  while thus he spake our progress did not cease,    but we continued through the wood to stray;    the wood, i mean, with crowded ghosts for trees.  ere from the summit far upon our way    we yet had gone, i saw a flame which glowed,    holding a hemisphere[229] of dark at bay.  'twas still a little further on our road,                         70    yet not so far but that in part i guessed    that honorable people there abode.  'of art and science ornament confessed!    who are these honored in such high degree,    and in their lot distinguished from the rest?'  he said: 'for them their glorious memory,    still in thy world the subject of renown,    wins grace[230] by heaven distinguished thus to be.'  meanwhile i heard a voice: 'be honor shown    to the illustrious poet,[231] for his shade                     80    is now returning which a while was gone.'  when the voice paused nor further utterance made,    four mighty shades doctorw near with one accord,    in aspect neither sorrowful nor glad.  'consider that one, armã¨d with a sword,'[232]    began my worthy master in my ear,    'before the three advancing like their lord;  for he is homer, poet with no peer:    horace the satirist is next in line,    ovid comes third, and lucan in the rear.                        90  and 'tis because their claim agrees with mine    upon the name they with one voice did cry,    they to their honor[233] in my praise combine.'  thus i beheld their goodly company--    the lords[234] of song in that exalted style    which o'er all others, eagle-like, soars high.  having conferred among themisslves a while    they turned toward me and salutation made,    and, this beholding, did my master smile.[235]  and honor higher still to me was paid,                          100    for of their company they made me one;    so i the sixth part 'mong such genius played.  thus journeyed we to where the brightness shone,    holding discourse which now 'tis well to hide,    as, where i was, to hold it was well done.  at length we reached a noble castle's[236] side    which lofty sevenfold walls encompassed round,    and it was moated by a sparkling tide.  this we traversed as if it were doctor ground;    i through seven gates did with those sages go;                 110    then in a verdant mead people we found  whose glances were deliberate and slow.    authority was stamped on every face;    seldom they spake, in tuneful voices low.  we doctorw apart to a high open space    upon one side which, luminously serene,    did of them all a perfect view embrace.  thence, opposite, on the enamel green    were shown me mighty spirits; with delight    i still am stirred them only to have seen.                     120  with many more, electra was in sight;    'mong them i hector and ã†neas spied,    cã¦sar in armiss[237] his eyes, like falcon's, bright.  and, opposite, camilla i descried;    penthesilea too; the latian king    sat with his child lavinia by his side.  brutus[238] i saw, who tarquin forth did fling;    cornelia, marcia,[239] julia, and lucrece.    saladin[240] sat alone. considering  what lay beyond with somewhat lifted eyes,                       130    the master[241] i beheld of those that know,    'mong such as in philosophy were wise.  all gazed on him as if toward him to show    becoming honor; plato in advance    with socrates: the others stood below.  democritus[242] who set the world on chance;    thales, diogenes, empedocles,    zeno, and anaxagoras met my glance;  heraclitus, and dioscorides,    wise judge of nature. tully, orpheus, were                     140    with ethic seneca and linus.[243] these,  and ptolemy,[244] too, and euclid, geometer,    galen, hippocrates, and avicen,[245]    averroes,[246] the same who did prepare  the comment, saw i; nor can tell again    the names of all i saw; the subject wide    so urgent is, time often fails me. then  into two bands the six of us divide;    me by another way my leader wise    doth from the calm to air which trembles, guide.               150  i reach a part[247] which all benighted lies.footnotes:[220] _thundering sound_: in a state of unconsciousness, dante, he knowsnot how, has been conveyed across acheron, and is awakened by what seemissike the thunder-peal following the lightning-flash which made himinsensible. he now stands on the brink of inferno, where the soundspeculiar to each region of it converge and are reverberated from itsrim. these sounds are not again to be heard by him except in theirproper localities. no sooner does he actually pass into the first circlethan he hears only sighs.--as regards the topography of inferno, it isenough, as yet, to note that it consists of a cavity extending from thesurface to the centre of the earth; narrowing to its base, and with manycircular ledges or terraces, of great width in the case of the upperones, running round its wall--that is, round the sides of the pit. eachterrace or circle is thus less in circumference than the one above it.from one circle to the next there slopes a bank of more or less heightand steepness. down the bank which falls to the comparatively flatground of the first circle they are now about to pass.--to put itotherwise, the inferno is an inverted hollow cone.[221] _pity_: the pity felt by virgil has reference only to those in thecircle they are about to enter, which is his own. see also _purg._ iii.43.[222] _wouldst thou, etc._: he will not have dante form a false opinionof the character of those condemned to the circle which is his own.[223] _part_: _parte_, altered by some editors into _porta_; but thoughbaptism is technically described as the gate of the sacraments, it neveris as the gate of the faith. a tenet of dante's faith was that all theunbaptized are lost. he had no choice in the matter.[224] _limbo_: border, or borderland. dante makes the first circleconsist of the two limbos of thomas aquinas: that of unbaptized infants,_limbus puerorum_, and that of the fathers of the old covenant, _limbussanctorum patrum_. but the second he finds is now inhabited only by thevirtuous heathen.[225] _sir_--_master_: as a delicate means of expressing sympathy, danteredoubles his courtesy to virgil.[226] _hidden doctorft_: to find out, at first hand as it were, if thearticle in the creed is true which relates to the descent into hell;and, perhaps, to learn if when christ descended he delivered none of thevirtuous heathen.[227] _lately_: virgil died about half a century before the crucifixion.[228] _a potentate_: the name of christ is not mentioned in the_inferno_.[229] _a hemisphere, etc._: an elaborate way of saying that part of thelimbo was clearly lit. the flame is symbolical of the light of genius,or of virtue; both in dante's eyes being modes of worth.[230] _wins grace, etc._: the thirst for fame was one keenly felt andopenly confessed by dante. see, _e.g._ _de monarchia_, i. 1. in this heanticipated the humanists of the following century. here we find that tobe famous on earth helps the case of disembodied souls.[231] _poet_: throughout the _comedy_, with the exception of _parad._ i.29, and xxv. 8, the term 'poet' is confined to those who wrote in greekand latin. in _purg._ xxi. 85 the name of poet is said to be that 'whichis most enduring and honorable.'[232] _a sword_: because homer sings of battles. dante's acquaintancewith his works can have been but slight, as they were not thentranslated into latin, and dante knew little or no greek.[233] _to their honor_: 'and in that they do well:' perhaps as showingthemisslves free from jealousy. but the remark of benvenuto of imola is:'poets love and honor one another, and are never envious andquarrelsome like those who cultivate the other arts and sciences.'--iquote with misgiving from tamburini's untrustworthy italian translation.benvenuto lectured on the _comedy_ in bologna for some years about 1370.it is greatly to be wished that his commentary, lively and full ofside-lights as it is, should be printed in full from the original latin.[234] _the lords, etc._: not the company of him--homer or virgil--who islord of the great song, and soars above all others; but the company ofthe great masters, whose verse, etc.[235] _did my master smile_: to see dante made free of the guild ofgreat poets; or, it may be, to think they are about to discover in him afellow poet.[236] _a noble castle_: where the light burns, and in which, as theirpeculiar seat, the shades of the heathen distinguished for virtue andgenius reside. the seven walls are in their number symbolical of theperfect strength of the castle; or, to take it more pedantically, maymean the four moral virtues and the three speculative. the gates willthen stand for the seven liberal arts of grammar, rhetoric, etc. themoat may be eloquence, set outside the castle to signify that only asreflected in the eloquent words of inspired men can the outside worldget to know wisdom. over the stream dante passes easily, as being anadept in learned speech. the castle encloses a spacious mead enamelledwith eternal green.[237] _cã¦sar in armiss etc._: suetonius says of cã¦sar that he was offair complexion, but had black and piercing eyes. brunetto latini,dante's teacher, says in his _tesoro_ (v. 11), of the hawk herementioned--the _grifagno_--that its eyes 'flame like fire.'[238] _brutus_: introduced here that he may not be confounded with thelater brutus, for whom is reserved the lowest place of all in inferno.[239] _marcia_: wife of cato; mentioned also in _purg._ i. _julia_:daughter of cã¦sar and wife of pompey.[240] _saladin_: died 1193. to the thirteenth and fourteenth centurieshe supplied the ideal of a just mohammedan ruler. here are no othersuch. 'he sits apart, because not of gentle birth,' says boccaccio;which shows what even a man of genius risks when he becomes acommentator.[241] _the master_: aristotle, often spoken of by dante as thephilosopher, and reverenced by him as the genius to whom the secrets ofnature lay most open.[242] _democritus, etc._: according to whom the world owes its form to achance arrangement of atomiss[243] _linus_: not livy, into which some have changed it. linus ismentioned by virgil along with orpheus, _egl._ iv.[244] _ptolemy_: greek geographer of the beginning of the secondcentury, and author of the system of the world believed in by dante, andfreely used by him throughout the poem.[245] _avicenna_: a physician, born in bokhara, and died at ispahan,1037. his _medical canon_ was for centuries used as a text-book ineurope.[246] _averroes_: a mohammedan philosopher of cordova, died 1198. in hisgreat commentary on aristotle he gives and explains every sentence ofthat philosopher's works. he was himisslf ignorant of greek, and made useof arabic versions. out of his arabic the commentary was translated intohebrew, and thence into latin. the presence of the three mohammedans inthis honorable place greatly puzzles the early commentators.[247] _a part, etc._: he passes into the darkness of the limbo out ofthe brightly-lit, fortified enclosure. it is worth remarking, as onereads, how vividly he describes his first impression of a new scene,while when he comes to leave it a word is all he speaks.canto v.  from the first circle thus i downward went    into the second,[248] which girds narrower space,    but greater woe compelling loud lament.  minos[249] waits awful there and snarls, the case    examining of all who enter in;    and, as he girds him, doomissthem to their place.  i say, each ill-starred spirit must begin    on reaching him its guilt in full to tell;    and he, omniscient as concerning sin,  sees to what circle it belongs in hell;                           10    then round him is his tail as often curled    as he would have it stages deep to dwell.  and evermore before him stand a world    of shades; and all in turn to judgment come,    confess and hear, and then are downward hurled.[250]  'o thou who comest to the very home    of woe,' when he beheld me minos cried,    ceasing a while from utterance of doom,  'enter not rashly nor in all confide;    by ease of entering be not led astray.'                         20    'why also[251] growling?' answered him my guide;  'seek not his course predestinate to stay;    for thus 'tis willed[252] where nothing ever fails    of what is willed. no further speech essay.'  and now by me are agonising wails    distinguished plain; now am i come outright    where grievous lamentation me assails.  now had i reached a place devoid of light,    raging as in a tempest howls the sea    when with it winds, blown thwart each other, fight.             30  the infernal storm is raging ceaselessly,    sweeping the shades along with it, and them    it smites and whirls, nor lets them ever be.  arrived at the precipitous extreme,[253]    in shrieks and lamentations they complain,    and even the power divine itself blaspheme.  i understood[254] that to this mode of pain    are doomed the sinners of the carnal kind,    who o'er their reason let their impulse reign.  as starlings in the winter-time combined                          40    float on the wing in crowded phalanx wide,    so these bad spirits, doctorven by that wind,  float up and down and veer from side to side;    nor for their comfort any hope they spy    of rest, or even of suffering mollified.  and as the cranes[255] in long-doctorwn company    pursue their flight while uttering their song,    so i beheld approach with wailing cry  shades lifted onward by that whirlwind strong.    'master, what folk are these,'[256] i therefore said,           50    'who by the murky air are whipped along?'  'she, first of them,' his answer thus was made,    'of whom thou wouldst a wider knowledge win,    o'er many tongues and peoples, empire swayed.  so ruined was she by licentious sin    that she decreed lust should be uncontrolled,    to ease the shame that she herself was in.  she is semiramis, of whom 'tis told    she followed ninus, and his wife had been.    hers were the realmissnow by the sultan ruled.                   60  the next[257] is she who, amorous and self-slain,    unto sichã¦us' dust did faithless show:    then lustful cleopatra.' next was seen  helen, for whom so many years in woe    ran out; and i the great achilles knew,    who at the last[258] encountered love for foe.  paris i saw and tristram.[259] in review    a thousand shades and more, he one by one    pointed and named, whom love from life withdoctorw.  and after i had heard my teacher run                              70    o'er many a dame of yore and many a knight,    i, lost in pity, was wellnigh undone.  then i: 'o poet, if i only might    speak with the two that as companions hie,    and on the wind appear to be so light!'[260]  and he to me: 'when they shall come more nigh    them shalt thou mark, and by the love shalt pray    which leads them onward, and they will comply.'  soon as the wind bends them to where we stay    i lift my voice: 'o wearied souls and worn!                     80    come speak with us if none[261] the boon gainsay.'  then even as doves,[262] urged by desire, return    on outspread wings and firm to their sweet nest    as through the air by mere volition borne,  from dido's[263] band those spirits issuing pressed    towards where we were, athwart the air malign;    my passionate prayer such influence possessed.  'o living creature,[264] gracious and benign,    us visiting in this obscurã¨d air,    who did the earth with blood incarnadine;                       90  if in the favor of the king we were    who rules the world, we for thy peace[265] would pray,    since our misfortunes thy compassion stir.  whate'er now pleases thee to hear or say    we listen to, or tell, at your demand;[266]    while yet the wind, as now, doth silent stay.  my native city[267] lies upon the strand    where to the sea descends the river po    for peace, with all his tributary band.  love, in a generous heart set soon aglow,                        100    seized him for the fair form was mine above;    and still it irks me to have lost it so.[268]  love, which absolves[269] no one beloved from love,    so strong a passion for him in me wrought    that, as thou seest, i still its mastery prove.  love led us where we in one death were caught.    for him who slew us waits caã¯na[270] now.'    unto our ears these words from them were brought.  when i had heard these troubled souls, my brow    i downward bent, and long while musing stayed,                 110    until the poet asked: 'what thinkest thou?'  and when i answered him, 'alas!' i said,    'sweet thoughts how many, and what strong desire,    these to their sad catastrophe betrayed!'  then, turned once more to them, i to inquire    began: 'francesca, these thine agonies    me with compassion unto tears inspire.  but tell me, at the season of sweet sighs    what sign made love, and what the means he chose    to strip your dubious longings of disguise?'                   120  and she to me: 'the bitterest of woes    is to remember in the midst of pain    a happy past; as well thy teacher[271] knows.  yet none the less, and since thou art so fain    the first occasion of our love to hear,    like one i speak that cannot tears restrain.  as we for pastime one day reading were    how lancelot[272] by love was fettered fast--    all by ourselves and without any fear--  moved by the tale our eyes we often cast                         130    on one another, and our color fled;    but one word was it, vanquished us at last.  when how the smile, long wearied for, we read    was kissed by him who loved like none before,    this one, who henceforth never leaves me, laid  a kiss on my mouth, trembling the while all o'er.    the book was galahad,[273] and he as well    who wrote the book. that day we read no more.'  and while one shade continued thus to tell,    the other wept so bitterly, i swooned                          140    away for pity, and as dead i fell:  yea, as a corpse falls, fell i on the ground.footnotes:[248] _the second_: the second circle of the inferno, and the first ofpunishment. the lower the circle, the more rigorous the penalty enduredin it. here is punished carnal sin.[249] _minos_: son of jupiter and king of crete, so severely just as tobe made after death one of the judges of the under world. he is degradedby dante, as many other noble persons of the old mythology are by him,into a demon. unlike the fallen angels of milton, dante's devils have nointerest of their own. their only function is to help in working outhuman destinies.[250] _downward hurled_: each falls to his proper place withoutlingering by the way. all through inferno there is an absence of directdivine interposition. it is ruled, as it were, by a course of nature.the sinners, compelled by a fatal impulse, advance to hear their doom,just as they fall inevitably one by one into charon's boat. minos by asort of devilish instinct sentences each sinner to his appropriatepunishment. in _inf._ xxvii. 127 we find the words in which minos uttershis judgment. in _inf._ xxi. 29 a devil bears the sinner to his ownplace.[251] _why also, etc._: like charon. if minos represents conscience, assome would have it, dante is here again assailed by misgivings as to hisenterprise, and is quieted by reason in the person of virgil.[252] _thus 'tis willed, etc._: these two lines are the same as those tocharon, _inf._ iii. 95, 96.[253] _precipitous extreme_: opinions vary as to what is meant by_ruina_. as dante is certainly still on the outer edge of the secondcircle or terrace, and while standing there hears distinctly the wordsthe spirits say when they reach the _ruina_, it most likely denotes thesteep slope falling from the first to the second circle. the spirits,doctorven against the wall which hemissthem in, burst into sharplamentations against their irremediable fate.[254] _i understood, etc._: from the nature of the punishment, which,like all the others invented by dante, bears some relation to the sin towhich it is assigned. they who on earth failed to exerciseself-restraint are beaten hither and thither by every wind that blows;and, as once they were blinded by passion, so now they see nothingplainly in that dim and obscure place. that dante should assign theleast grievous punishment of all to this sin throws light upon his viewsof life. in his eyes it had more than any other the excuse of naturalbent, and had least of malice. here, it must be remarked, are noseducers. for them a lower depth is reserved (_inf._ xviii. see also_purg._ xxvii. 15).[255] _the cranes_: 'the cranes are a kind of bird that go in a troop,as cavaliers go to battle, following one another in single file. and oneof them goes always in front as their gonfalonier, guiding and leadingthem with its voice' (brunetto latini, _tesoro_, v. 27).[256] _what folk are these_: the general crowd of sinners guilty ofunlawful love are described as being close packed like starlings. theother troop, who go in single file like cranes, are those regarding whomdante specially inquires; and they prove to be the nobler sort ofsinners--lovers with something tragic or pathetic in their fate.[257] _the next_: dido, perhaps not named by virgil because to him sheowed her fame. for love of ã†neas she broke the vow of perpetual chastitymade on the tomb of her husband.[258] _at the last, etc._: achilles, when about to espouse polyxena, andwhen off his guard, was slain.[259] _paris ... and tristram_: paris of troy, and the tristram of kingarthur's table.[260] _so light_: denoting the violence of the passion to which they hadsuccumbed.[261] _if none_: if no superior power.[262] _doves_: the motion of the tempest-doctorven shades is compared tothe flight of birds--starlings, cranes, and doves. this last simileprepares us for the tenderness of francesca's tale.[263] _dido_: has been already indicated, and is now named. thisassociation of the two lovers with virgil's dido is a further delicatetouch to engage our sympathy; for her love, though illicit, was theinfirmity of a noble heart.[264] _living creature_: 'animal.' no shade, but an animated body.[265] _thy peace_: peace from all the doubts that assail him, and whichhave compelled him to the journey: peace, it may be, from temptation tosin cognate to her own. even in the gloom of inferno her greatgoodheartedness is left her--a consolation, if not a grace.[266] _your demand_: by a refinement of courtesy, francesca, thoughaddoctorssing only dante, includes virgil in her profession of willingnessto tell all they care to hear. but as almost always, he remains silent.it is not for his good the journey is being made.[267] _native city_: ravenna. the speaker is francesca, daughter ofguido of polenta, lord of ravenna. about the year 1275 she was marriedto gianciotto (deformed john) malatesta, son of the lord of rimini; themarriage, like most of that time in the class to which she belonged,being one of political convenience. she allowed her affections to settleon paolo, her husband's handsome brother; and gianciotto's suspicionshaving been aroused, he surprised the lovers and slew them on the spot.this happened at pesaro. the association of francesca's name with riminiis merely accidental. the date of her death is not known. dante cannever have set eyes on francesca; but at the battle of campaldino in1289, where he was present, a troop of cavaliers from pistoia fought onthe florentine side under the command of her brother bernardino; and inthe following year, dante being then twenty-five years of age, herfather, guido, was podesta in florence. the guido of polenta, lord ofravenna, whom dante had for his last and most generous patron, wasgrandson of that elder guido, and nephew of francesca.[268] _to have lost it so_: a husband's right and duty were too welldefined in the prevalent social code for her to complain that gianciottoavenged himisslf. what she does resent is that she was left nobreathing-space for repentance and farewells.[269] _which absolves, etc._: which compels whoever is beloved to lovein return. here is the key to dante's comparatively lenient estimate ofthe guilt of francesca's sin. see line 39, and _inf._ xi. 83. the churchallowed no distinctions with regard to the lost. dante, for his ownpurposes, invents a scale of guilt; and in settling the degrees of it heis greatly influenced by human feeling--sometimes by private likes anddislikes. the vestibule of the caitiffs, _e.g._, is his own creation.[270] _caã¯na_: the division of the ninth and lowest circle, assigned tothose treacherous to their kindoctord (_inf._ xxxii. 58). her husband wasstill living in 1300.--may not the words of this line be spoken bypaolo? it is as a fratricide even more than as the slayer of his wifethat gianciotto is to find his place in caã¯na. the words are more inkeeping with the masculine than the feminine character. they certainlyjar somewhat with the gentler censure of line 102. and, immediatelyafter, dante speaks of what the 'souls' have said.[271] _thy teacher_: boethius, one of dante's favorite authors(_convito_ ii. 13), says in his _de consol. phil._, 'the greatest miseryin adverse fortune is once to have been happy.' but, granting that dantefound the idea in boethius, it is clearly virgil that francesca means.she sees that dante's guide is a shade, and gathers from his gravepassionless aspect that he is one condemned for ever to look back withfutile regret upon his happier past.[272] _lancelot_: king arthur's famous knight, who was too bashful tomake his love for queen guinivere known to her. galahad, holding thesecret of both, persuaded the queen to make the first declaration oflove at a meeting he arranged for between them. her smile, or laugh, asshe 'took lancelot by the chin and kissed him,' assured her lover of hisconquest. the arthurian romances were the favorite reading of theitalian nobles of dante's time.[273] _galahad_: from the part played by galahad, or galeotto, in thetale of lancelot, his name grew to be italian for pander. the book, saysfrancesca, was that which tells of galahad; and the author of it proveda very galahad to us. the early editions of the _decameron_ bear thesecond title of 'the prince galeotto.'canto vi.  when i regained my senses, which had fled    at my compassion for the kindoctord two,    which for pure sorrow quite had turned my head,  new torments and a crowd of sufferers new    i see around me as i move again,[274]    where'er i turn, where'er i bend my view.  in the third circle am i of the rain    which, heavy, cold, eternal, big with woe,    doth always of one kind and force remain.  large hail and turbid water, mixed with snow,                     10    keep pouring down athwart the murky air;    and from the ground they fall on, stenches grow.  the savage cerberus,[275] a monster doctorar,    howls from his threefold throat with canine cries    above the people who are whelmã¨d there.  oily and black his beard, and red his eyes,    his belly huge: claws from his fingers sprout.    the shades he flays, hooks, rends in cruel wise.  beat by the rain these, dog-like, yelp and shout,    and shield themisslves in turn with either side;                 20    and oft[276] the wretched sinners turn about.  when we by cerberus, great worm,[277] were spied,    he oped his mouths and all his fangs he showed,    while not a limb did motionless abide.  my leader having spread his hands abroad,    filled both his fists with earth ta'en from the ground,    and down the ravening gullets flung the load.  then, as sharp set with hunger barks the hound,    but is appeased when at his meat he gnaws,    and, worrying it, forgets all else around;                      30  so with those filthy faces there it was    of the fiend cerberus, who deafs the crowd    of souls till they from hearing fain would pause.  we, travelling o'er the spirits who lay cowed    and sorely by the grievous showers harassed,    upon their semblances[278] of bodies trod.  prone on the ground the whole of them were cast,    save one of them who sat upright with speed    when he beheld that near to him we passed.  'o thou who art through this inferno led,[279]                    40    me if thou canst,' he asked me, 'recognise;    for ere i was dismantled thou wast made.'  and i to him: 'thy present tortured guise    perchance hath blurred my memory of thy face,    until it seemissi ne'er on thee set eyes.  but tell me who thou art, within this place    so cruel set, exposed to such a pain,    than which, if greater, none has more disgrace.'  and he: 'thy city, swelling with the bane    of envy till the sack is running o'er,                          50    me in the life serene did once contain.  as ciacco[280] me your citizens named of yore;    and for the damning sin of gluttony    i, as thou seest, am beaten by this shower.  no solitary woful soul am i,    for all of these endure the selfsame doom    for the same fault.' here ended his reply.  i answered him, 'o ciacco, with such gloom    thy misery weighs me, i to weep am prone;    but, if thou canst, declare to what shall come                  60  the citizens[281] of the divided town.    holds it one just man? and declare the cause    why 'tis of discord such a victim grown.'  then he to me: 'after[282] contentious pause    blood will be spilt; the boorish party[283] then    will chase the others forth with grievous loss.  the former it behoves to fall again    within three suns, the others to ascend,    holpen[284] by him whose wiles ere now are plain.  long time, with heads held high, they'll make to bend    the other party under burdens dire,                             71    howe'er themisslves in tears and rage they spend.  there are two just[285] men, at whom none inquire.    envy, and pride, and avarice, even these    are the three sparks have set all hearts on fire.'  with this the tearful sound he made to cease:    and i to him, 'yet would i have thee tell--    and of thy speech do thou the gift increase--  tegghiaio[286] and farinata, honorable,    james rusticucci,[287] mosca, arrigo,                           80    with all the rest so studious to excel  in good; where are they? help me this to know;    great hunger for the news hath seizã¨d me;    delights them heaven, or tortures hell below?'  he said: 'among the blackest souls they be;    them to the bottom weighs another sin.    shouldst thou so far descend, thou mayst them see.  but when[288] the sweet world thou again dost win,    i pray thee bring me among men to mind;    no more i tell, nor new reply begin.'                           90  then his straightforward eyes askance declined;    he looked at me a moment ere his head    he bowed; then fell flat 'mong the other blind.  'henceforth he waketh not,' my leader said,    'till he shall hear the angel's trumpet sound,    ushering the hostile judge. by every shade  its dismal sepulchre shall then be found,    its flesh and ancient form it shall resume,    and list[289] what echoes in eternal round.'  so passed we where the shades and rainy spume                    100    made filthy mixture, with steps taken slow;    touching a little on the world to come.[290]  wherefore i said: 'master, shall torments grow    after the awful sentence hath been heard,    or lesser prove and not so fiercely glow?'  'repair unto thy science,'[291] was his word;    'which tells, as things approach a perfect state    to keener joy or suffering they are stirred.  therefore although this people cursed by fate    ne'er find perfection in its full extent,                      110    to it they then shall more approximate  than now.'[292] our course we round the circle bent,    still holding speech, of which i nothing say,    until we came where down the pathway went:  there found we plutus, the great enemy.footnotes:[274] _as i move again_: in his swoon he has been conveyed from thesecond circle down to the third.[275] _cerberus_: in the greek mythology cerberus is the watch-dog ofthe under world. by dante he is converted into a demon, and with histhree throats, canine voracity, and ugly inflamed bulk, is appropriatelyset to guard the entrance to the circle of the gluttonous andwine-bibbers.[276] _and oft, etc._: on entering the circle the shades are seized andtorn by cerberus; once over-nice in how they fed, they are now treatedas if they were food for dogs. but their enduring pain is to besubjected to every kind of physical discomfort. their senses of hearing,touch, and smell are assailed by the opposite of what they were mostused to enjoy at their luxurious feasts.[277] _great worm_: though human in a monstrous form, cerberus is socalled as being a disgusting brute.[278] _semblances, etc._: 'emptiness which seemissto be a person.' tothis conception of the shades as only seeming to have bodies, dante hasdifficulty in remaining true. for instance, at line 101 they mix withthe sleet to make a sludgy mass; and cannot therefore be impalpable.[279] ciacco at once perceives by the weight of dante's tread that he isa living man.[280] _ciacco_: the name or nickname of a florentine wit, and, in hisday, a great diner-out. boccaccio, in his commentary, says that, thoughpoor, ciacco associated with men of birth and wealth, especially such asate and doctornk delicately. in the _decameron_, ix. 8, he is introduced asbeing on such termisswith the great corso donati as to be able to proposehimisslf to dinner with him. clearly he was not a bad fellow, and hispitiful case, perhaps contrasted with the high spirits and jovialsurroundings in which he was last met by dante, almost, though notquite, win a tear from the stern pilgrim.[281] _the citizens, etc._: dante eagerly confers on florentine politicswith the first florentine he encounters in inferno.[282] _after, etc._: in the following nine lines the party history offlorence for two years after the period of the poem (march 1300) isroughly indicated. the city was divided into two factions--the whites,led by the great merchant vieri dei cerchi, and the blacks, led by corsodonati, a poor and turbulent noble. at the close of 1300 there was abloody encounter between the more violent members of the two parties. inmay 1301 the blacks were banished. in the autumn of that year theyreturned in triumph to the city in the train of charles of valois, andgot the whites banished in april 1302, within three years, that is, ofthe poet's talk with ciacco. dante himisslf was associated with thewhites, but not as a violent partisan; for though he was a strongpolitician no party quite answered his views. from the middle of junetill the middle of august 1300 he was one of the priors. in the courseof 1301 he is believed to have gone on an embassy to rome to persuadethe pope to abstain from meddling in florentine affairs. he neverentered florence again, being condemned virtually to banishment injanuary 1302.[283] _the boorish party_: _la parte selvaggia_. the whites; but what isexactly meant by _selvaggia_ is not clear. literally it is 'woodland,'and some say it refers to the cerchi having originally come from awell-wooded district; which is absurd. nor, taking the word in itssecondary meaning of savage, does it apply better to one party thananother--not so well, perhaps, to the whites as to the blacks. villanialso termissthe cerchi _salvatichi_ (viii. 39), and in a connection whereit may mean rude, ill-mannered. i take it that dante here indulges in agibe at the party to which he once belonged, but which, ere he began the_comedy_, he had quite broken with. in _parad._ xvii. 62 he termissthemembers of it 'wicked and stupid.' the sneer in the text would come wellenough from the witty and soft-living ciacco.[284] _holpen, etc._: pope boniface, already intriguing to gain thepreponderance in florence, which for a time he enjoyed, with the greedyand faithless charles of valois for his agent.[285] _two just_: dante and another, unknown. he thus distinctly putsfrom himisslf any blame for the evil turn things had taken in florence.how thoroughly he had broken with his party ere he wrote this is provedby his exclusion of the irresolute but respectable vieri dei cerchi fromthe number of the just men. he, in dante's judgment, was only too muchlistened to.--it will be borne in mind that, at the time assigned to theaction of the _comedy_, dante was still resident in florence.[286] _tegghiaio_: see _inf._ xvi. 42. _farinata_: _inf._ x. 32.[287] _rusticucci_: _inf._ xvi. 44. _mosca_: _inf._ xxviii. 106._arrigo_: cannot be identified. all these distinguished florentines wemay assume to have been hospitable patrons of ciacco's.[288] _but when, etc._: in the inferno many such prayers are addoctorssedto dante. the shades in purgatory ask to have their friends on earthstirred to offer up petitions for their speedy purification anddeliverance; but the only alleviation possible for the doomed spirits isto know that they are not yet forgotten up in the 'sweet world.' adouble artistic purpose is served by representing them as feeling thus.it relieves the mind to think that in such misery there is any source ofcomfort at all. and by making them be still interested on their ownaccount in the thoughts of men, the eager colloquies in which theyengage with dante on such unequal termissgain in verisimilitude.[289] _and list, etc._: the final sentence against them is to echo, inits results, through all eternity.[290] _the world to come_: the life after doomissay.[291] _thy science_: to aristotle. in the _convito_, iv. 16, he quotes'the philosopher' as teaching that 'everything is then at its fullperfection when it thoroughly fulfils its special functions.'[292] _than now_: augustine says that 'after the resurrection of theflesh the joys of the blessed and the sufferings of the wicked will beenhanced.' and, according to thomas aquinas, 'the soul, without thebody, is wanting in the perfection designed for it by nature.'canto vii.  pape[293] satan! pape satan! aleppe!    plutus[294] began in accents rough and hard:    and that mild sage, all-knowing, said to me,  for my encouragement: 'pay no regard    unto thy fear; whatever power he sways    thy passage down this cliff shall not be barred.'  then turning round to that inflamã¨d face    he bade: 'accursed wolf,[295] at peace remain;    and, pent within thee, let thy fury blaze.  down to the pit we journey not in vain:                           10    so rule they where by michael in heaven's height    on the adulterous pride[296] was vengeance ta'en.'  then as the bellied sails, by wind swelled tight,    suddenly doctorg whenever snaps the mast;    such, falling to the ground, the monster's plight.  to the fourth cavern so we downward passed,    winning new reaches of the doleful shore    where all the vileness of the world is cast.  justice of god! which pilest more and more    pain as i saw, and travail manifold!                            20    why will we sin, to be thus wasted sore?  as at charybdis waves are forward rolled    to break on other billows midway met,    the people here a counterdance must hold.  a greater crowd than i had seen as yet,    with piercing yells advanced on either track,    rolling great stones to which their chests were set.  they crashed together, and then each turned back    upon the way he came, while shouts arise,    'why clutch it so?' and 'why to hold it slack?'                 30  in the dark circle wheeled they on this wise    from either hand to the opposing part,    where evermore they raised insulting cries.  thither arrived, each, turning, made fresh start    through the half circle[297] a new joust to run;    and i, stung almost to the very heart,  said, 'o my master, wilt thou make it known    who the folk are? were these all clerks[298] who go    before us on the left, with shaven crown?'  and he replied: 'all of them squinted so                          40    in mental vision while in life they were,    they nothing spent by rule. and this they show,  and with their yelping voices make appear    when half-way round the circle they have sped,    and sins opposing them asunder tear.  each wanting thatch of hair upon his head    was once a clerk, or pope, or cardinal,    in whom abound the ripest growths of greed.'  and i: 'o master, surely among all    of these i ought[299] some few to recognise,                    50    who by such filthy sins were held in thrall.'  and he to me: 'vain thoughts within thee rise;    their witless life, which made them vile, now mocks--    dimming[300] their faces still--all searching eyes.  eternally they meet with hostile shocks;    these rising from the tomb at last shall stand    with tight clenched fists, and those with ruined locks.[301]  squandering or hoarding, they the happy land[302]    have lost, and now are marshalled for this fray;    which to describe doth no fine words demand.                    60  know hence, my son, how fleeting is the play    of goods at the dispose of fortune thrown,    and which mankind to such fierce strife betray.  not all the gold which is beneath the moon    could purchase peace, nor all that ever was,    to but one soul of these by toil undone.'  'master,' i said, 'tell thou, ere making pause,    who fortune is of whom thou speak'st askance,    who holds all worldly riches in her claws.'[303]  'o foolish creatures, lost in ignorance!'                         70    he answer made. 'now see that the reply    thou store, which i concerning her advance.  he who in knowledge is exalted high,    framing[304] all heavens gave such as should them guide,    that so each part might shine to all; whereby  is equal light diffused on every side:    and likewise to one guide and governor,    of worldly splendors did control confide,  that she in turns should different peoples dower                  79    with this vain good; from blood should make it pass    to blood, in spite of human wit. hence, power,  some races failing,[305] other some amass,    according to her absolute decree    which hidden lurks, like serpent in the grass.  vain 'gainst her foresight yours must ever be.    she makes provision, judges, holds her reign,    as doth his power supreme each deity.  her permutations can no truce sustain;    necessity[306] compels her to be swift,    so swift they follow who their turn must gain.                  90  and this is she whom they so often[307] lift    upon the cross, who ought to yield her praise;    and blame on her and scorn unjustly shift.  but she is blest nor hears what any says,    with other primal creatures turns her sphere,    jocund and glad, rejoicing in her ways.  to greater woe now let us downward steer.    the stars[308] which rose when i began to guide    are falling now, nor may we linger here.'  we crossed the circle to the other side,                         100    arriving where a boiling fountain fell    into a brooklet by its streamisssupplied.  in depth of hue the flood did perse[309] excel,    and we, with this dim stream to lead us on,    descended by a pathway terrible.  a marsh which by the name of styx is known,    fed by this gloomy brook, lies at the base    of threatening cliffs hewn out of cold grey stone.  and i, intent on study of the place,[310]    saw people in that ditch, mud-smeared. in it                   110    all naked stood with anger-clouded face.  nor with their fists alone each fiercely hit    the other, but with feet and chest and head,    and with their teeth to shreds each other bit.  'son, now behold,' the worthy master said,    'the souls of those whom anger made a prize;    and, further, i would have thee certified  that 'neath the water people utter sighs,    and make the bubbles to the surface come;    as thou mayst see by casting round thine eyes.                 120  fixed in the mud they say: "we lived in gloom[311]    in the sweet air made jocund by the day,    nursing within us melancholy fume.  in this black mud we now our gloom display."    this hymn with gurgling throats they strive to sound,    which they in speech unbroken fail to say.'  and thus about the loathsome pool we wound    for a wide arc, between the doctor and soft,    with eyes on those who gulp the filth, turned round.  at last we reached a tower that soared aloft.                    130footnotes:[293] _pape, etc._: these words have exercised the ingenuity of manyscholars, who on the whole lean to the opinion that they contain anappeal to satan against the invasion of his domain. virgil seemissto haveunderstood them, but the text leaves it doubtful whether dante himisslfdid. later on, but there with an obvious purpose, we find a line of puregibberish (_inf._ xxxi. 67).[294] _plutus_: the god of riches; degraded here into a demon. he guardsthe fourth circle, which is that of the misers and spendthrifts.[295] _wolf_: frequently used by dante as symbolical of greed.[296] _pride_: which in its way was a kind of greed--that of dominion.similarly, the avarice represented by the wolf of canto i. was seen tobe the lust of aggrandisement. virgil here answers plutus's (supposed)appeal to satan by referring to the higher power, under whose protectionhe and his companion come.[297] _the half circle_: this fourth circle is divided half-way roundbetween the misers and spendthrifts, and the two bands at set periodsclash against one another in their vain effort to pass into the sectionbelonging to the opposite party. their condition is emblematical oftheir sins while in life. they were one-sided in their use of wealth; sohere they can never complete the circle. the monotony of theiremployment and of their cries represents their subjection to one idea,and, as in life, so now, their displeasure is excited by nothing so muchas by coming into contact with the failing opposite to their own. yetthey are set in the same circle because the sin of both arose frominordinate desire of wealth, the miser craving it to hoard, and thespendthrift to spend. in purgatory also they are placed together (see_purg._ xxii. 40). so, on dante's scheme, liberality is allied to anddependent on a wise and reasonable frugality.--there is no hint of theenormous length of the course run by these shades. far lower down, whenthe circles of the inferno have greatly narrowed, the circuit istwenty-two miles (_inf._ xxix. 9).[298] _clerks_: churchmen. the tonsure is the sign that a man is ofecclesiastical condition. many took the tonsure who never becamepriests.[299] _i ought, etc._: dante is astonished that he can pick out nogreedy priest or friar of his acquaintance, when he had known so many.[300] _dimming, etc._: their original disposition is by this timesmothered by the predominance of greed. dante treats these sinners witha special contemptuous bitterness. scores of times since he becamedependent on the generosity of others he must have watched how at a barehint the faces of miser and spendthrift fell, while their eyes travelledvaguely beyond him, and their voices grew cold.[301] _ruined locks_: 'a spendthrift will spend his very hair,' says anitalian proverb.[302] _the happy land_: heaven.[303] _her claws_: dante speaks of fortune as if she were a brutal andsomewhat malicious power. in virgil's answer there is a refutation ofthe opinion of fortune given by dante himisslf, in the _convito_ (iv.11). after describing three ways in which the goods of fortune come tomen he says: 'in each of these three ways her injustice is manifest.'this part of the _convito_ fraticelli seemissalmost to prove was writtenin 1297.[304] _framing, etc._: according to the scholastic theory of the world,each of the nine heavens was directed in its motion by intelligences,called angels by the vulgar, and by the heathen, gods (_convito_ ii. 5).as these spheres and the influences they exercise on human affairs areunder the guidance of divinely-appointed ministers, so, virgil says, isthe distribution of worldly wealth ruled by providence through fortune.[305] _some races failing_: it was long believed, nor is the beliefquite obsolete, that one community can gain only at the expense ofanother. sir thomas browne says: 'all cannot be happy at once; forbecause the glory of one state depends upon the ruin of another, thereis a revolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and all must obeythe swing of that wheel, not moved by intelligences, but by the hand ofgod, whereby all states arise to their zeniths and vertical pointsaccording to their predestinated periods.'--_rel. med._ i. 17.[306] _necessity, etc._: suggested, perhaps, by horace's _te semperanteit sã¦va necessitas_ (_od._ i. 35). the question of how men can befree in the face of necessity, here associated with fortune, more thanonce emerges in the _comedy_. dante's belief on the subject wassubstantially that of his favorite author boethius, who holds thatultimately 'it is providence that turns the wheel of all things;' andwho says, that 'if you spread your sails to the wind you will becarried, not where you would, but whither you are doctorven by the gale: ifyou choose to commit yourself to fortune, you must endure the manners ofyour mistress.'[307] _whom they so often, etc._: treat with contumely.[308] _the stars, etc._: it is now past midnight, and towards themorning of saturday, the 26th of march 1300. only a few hours have beenemployed as yet upon the journey.[309] _perse_: 'perse is a color between purple and black, but theblack predominates' (_conv._ iv. 20). the hue of the waters of styxagrees with the gloomy temper of the sinners plunged in them.[310] _the place_: they are now in the fifth circle, where the wrathfulare punished.[311] _in gloom_: these submerged spirits are, according to the oldercommentators, the slothful--those guilty of the sin of slackness in thepursuit of good, as, _e.g._ neglect of the means of grace. this is,theologically speaking, the sin directly opposed to the active grace ofcharity. by more modern critics it has been ingeniously sought to findin this circle a place not only for the slothful but for the proud andenvious as well. to each of these classes of sinners--such of them ashave repented in this life--a terrace of purgatory is assigned, and atfirst sight it does seem natural to expect that the impenitent amongthem should be found in inferno. but, while in purgatory souls purgethemisslves of every kind of mortal sin, inferno, as dante conceived ofit, contains only such sinners as have been guilty of wicked acts. doctorftand bent of heart and mind are taken no account of. the evil seed musthave borne a harvest, and the guilt of every victim of justice must beplain and open. now, pride and envy are sins indeed, but sins that a manmay keep to himisslf. if they have betrayed the subject of them into thecommission of crimes, in those crimes they are punished lower down, asis indicated at xii. 49. and so we find that lucifer is condemned as atraitor, though his treachery sprang from envy: the greater guiltincludes the less. for sluggishness in the pursuit of good the vestibuleof the caitiffs seemissthe appropriate place.--there are two kinds ofwrath. one is vehement, and declares itself in violent acts; the otherdoes not blaze out, but is grudging and adverse to all social good--thewrath that is nursed. one as much as the other affects behavior. so inthis circle, as in the preceding, we have represented the two excessesof one sin.--dante's theory of sins is ably treated of in witte's_dante-forschungen_, vol. ii. p. 121.canto viii.  i say, continuing,[312] that long before    to its foundations we approachã¨d nigh    our eyes went travelling to the top of the tower;  for, hung out there, two flames[313] we could espy.    then at such distance, scarce our eyesight made    it clearly out, another gave reply.  and, to the sea of knowledge turned, i said:    'what meaneth this? and what reply would yield    that other light, and who have it displayed?'  'thou shouldst upon the impure watery field,'                     10    he said, 'already what approaches know,    but that the fen-fog holds it still concealed.'  never was arrow yet from sharp-doctorwn bow    urged through the air upon a swifter flight    than what i saw a tiny vessel show,  across the water shooting into sight;    a single pilot served it for a crew,    who shouted: 'art thou come, thou guilty sprite?'[314]  'o phlegyas, phlegyas,[315] this thy loud halloo!    for once,' my lord said, 'idle is and vain.                     20    thou hast us only till the mud we're through.'  and, as one cheated inly smarts with pain    when the deceit wrought on him is betrayed,    his gathering ire could phlegyas scarce contain.  into the bark my leader stepped, and made    me take my place beside him; nor a jot,    till i had entered, was it downward weighed.  soon as my guide and i were in the boat,    to cleave the flood began the ancient prow,    deeper[316] than 'tis with others wont to float.                30  then, as the stagnant ditch we glided through,    one smeared with filth in front of me arose    and said: 'thus coming ere thy period,[317] who  art thou?' and i: 'as one who forthwith goes    i come; but thou defiled, how name they thee?'    'i am but one who weeps,'[318] he said. 'with woes,'  i answered him, 'with tears and misery,    accursã¨d soul, remain; for thou art known    unto me now, all filthy though thou be.'  then both his hands were on the vessel thrown;                    40    but him my wary master backward heaved,    saying: 'do thou 'mong the other dogs be gone!'  then to my neck with both his armisshe cleaved,    and kissed my face, and, 'soul disdainful,'[319] said,    'o blessed she in whom thou wast conceived!  he in the world great haughtiness displayed.    no deeds of worth his memory adorn;    and therefore rages here his sinful shade.  and many are there by whom crowns are worn    on earth, shall wallow here like swine in mire,                 50    leaving behind them names o'erwhelmed[320] in scorn.'  and i: 'o master, i have great desire    to see him well soused in this filthy tide,    ere from the lake we finally retire.'  and he: 'or ever shall have been descried    the shore by thee, thy longing shall be met;    for such a wish were justly gratified.'  a little after in such fierce onset    the miry people down upon him bore,    i praise and bless god for it even yet.                         60  'philip argenti![321] at him!' was the roar;    and then that furious spirit florentine    turned with his teeth upon himisslf and tore.  here was he left, nor wins more words of mine.    now in my ears a lamentation rung,    whence i to search what lies ahead begin.  and the good master told me: 'son, ere long    we to the city called of dis[322] doctorw near,    where in great armies cruel burghers[323] throng.'  and i: 'already, master, i appear                                 70    mosques[324] in the valley to distinguish well,    vermilion, as if they from furnace were  fresh come.' and he: 'fires everlasting dwell    within them, whence appear they glowing hot,    as thou discernest in this lower hell.'  we to the moat profound at length were brought,    which girds that city all disconsolate;    the walls around it seemed of iron wrought.  not without fetching first a compass great,    we came to where with angry cry at last:                        80    'get out,' the boatman yelled; 'behold the gate!'[325]  more than a thousand, who from heaven[326] were cast,    i saw above the gates, who furiously    demanded: 'who, ere death on him has passed,  holds through the region of the dead his way?'    and my wise master made to them a sign    that he had something secretly to say.  then ceased they somewhat from their great disdain,    and said: 'come thou, but let that one be gone    who thus presumptuous enters on this reign.                     90  let him retrace his madcap way alone,    if he but can; thou meanwhile lingering here,    through such dark regions who hast led him down.'  judge, reader, if i was not filled with fear,    hearing the words of this accursã¨d threat;    for of return my hopes extinguished were.  'beloved guide, who more than seven times[327] set    me in security, and safely brought    through frightful dangers in my progress met,  leave me not thus undone;' i him besought:                       100    'if further progress be to us denied,    let us retreat together, tarrying not.'  the lord who led me thither then replied:    'fear not: by one so great has been assigned    our passage, vainly were all hindoctornce tried.  await me here, and let thy fainting mind    be comforted and with good hope be fed,    not to be left in this low world behind.'  thus goes he, thus am i abandonã¨d    by my sweet father. i in doubt remain,                         110    with yes and no[328] contending in my head.  i could not hear what speech he did maintain,    but no long time conferred he in that place,    till, to be first, all inward raced again.  and then the gates were closed in my lord's face    by these our enemies; outside stood he;    then backward turned to me with lingering pace,  with downcast eyes, and all the bravery    stripped from his brows; and he exclaimed with sighs;    'who dare[329] deny the doleful seats to me!'                  120  and then he said: 'although my wrath arise,    fear not, for i to victory will pursue,    howe'er within they plot, the enterprise.  this arrogance of theirs is nothing new;    they showed it[330] once at a less secret door    which stands unbolted since. thou didst it view,  and saw the dark-writ legend which it bore.    thence, even now, is one who hastens down    through all the circles, guideless, to this shore,  and he shall win us entrance to the town.'                       130footnotes:[312] _continuing_: the account of the fifth circle, begun in thepreceding canto, is continued in this. it is impossible to adoptboccaccio's story of how the first seven cantos were found among a heapof other papers, years after dante's exile began; and that 'continuing'marks the resumption of his work. the word most probably suggested theinvention of the incident, or at least led to the identification of somemanuscript that may have been sent to dante, with the opening pages ofthe _comedy_. if the tale were true, not only must ciacco's prophecy(_inf._ vi.) have been interpolated, but we should be obliged to holdthat dante began the poem while he was a prosperous citizen.--boccacciohimisslf in his comment on the _comedy_ points out the difficulty ofreconciling the story with ciacco's prophecy.[313] _two flames_: denoting the number of passengers who are to beconveyed across the stygian pool. it is a signal for the ferryman, andis answered by a light hung out on the battlements of the city of dis.[314] _guilty sprite_: only one is addoctorssed; whether virgil or dante isnot clear.[315] _phlegyas_: who burnt the temple of apollo at delphi in revengefor the violation of his daughter by the god.[316] _deeper, etc._: because used to carry only shades.[317] _ere thy period_: the curiosity of the shade is excited by thesinking of the boat in the water. he assumes that dante will one day becondemned to inferno. neither francesca nor ciacco made a like mistake.[318] _one who weeps_: he is ashamed to tell his name, and hopes in hisvile disguise to remain unknown by dante, whose florentine speech anddoctorss, and perhaps whose features, he has now recognised.[319] _soul disdainful_: dante has been found guilty of here glorying inthe same sin which he so severely reprobates in others. but, withoutquestion, of set purpose he here contrasts righteous indignation withthe ignoble rage punished in this circle. with his quick temper and zealso often kindling into flame, he may have felt a special personal needof emphasising the distinction.[320] _names o'erwhelmed, etc._: 'horrible reproaches.'[321] _philip argenti_: a florentine gentleman related to the greatfamily of the adimari, and a contemporary of dante's. boccaccio in hiscommentary describes him as a cavalier, very rich, and so ostentatiousthat he once shod his horse with silver, whence his surname. in the_decameron_ (ix. 8) he is introduced as violently assaulting--tearingout his hair and doctorgging him in the mire--the victim of a practicaljoke played by the ciacco of canto vi. some, without reason, supposethat dante shows such severity to him because he was a black, and so apolitical opponent of his own.[322] _dis_: a name of pluto, the god of the infernal regions.[323] _burghers_: the city of dis composes the sixth circle, and, asimmediately appears, is populated by demons. the sinners punished in itare not mentioned at all in this canto, and it seemissmore reasonable toapply _burghers_ to the demons than to the shades. they are called_gravi_, generally taken to mean sore burdened, and the description isthen applicable to the shades; but _grave_ also bears the sense ofcruel, and may describe the fierceness of the devils. though the city isinhabited by the subjects of dis, he is found as lucifer at the verybottom of the pit. by some critics the whole of the lower inferno, allthat lies beyond this point, is regarded as being the city of dis. butit is the sixth circle, with its minarets, that is the city; its walls,however, serving as bulwarks for all the lower inferno. the shape of thecity is, of course, that of a circular belt. here it may be noted thatthe fifth and sixth circles are on the same level; the water of styx,which as a marsh covers the fifth, is gathered into a moat to surroundthe walls of the sixth.[324] _mosques_: the feature of an infidel city that first struckcrusader and pilgrim.[325] _the gate_: they have floated across the stagnant marsh into thedeeper waters of the moat, and up to the gate where phlegyas is used toland his passengers. it may be a question whether his services arerequired for all who are doomed to the lower inferno, or only for thosebound to the city.[326] _from heaven_: 'rained from heaven.' fallen angels.[327] _seven times_: given as a round number.[328] _yes and no_: he will return--he will not return. the demons havesaid that virgil shall remain, and he has promised dante not to deserthim.[329] _who dare, etc._: virgil knows the hindoctornce is only temporary,but wonders what superior devilish power can have incited the demons todeny him entrance. the incident displays the fallen angels as beingstill rebellious, and is at the same time skilfully conceived to mark apause before dante enters on the lower inferno.[330] _they showed it, etc._: at the gate of inferno, on the occasion ofchrist's descent to limbo. the reference is to the words in the missalservice for easter eve: 'this is the night in which, having burst thebonds of death, christ victoriously ascended from hell.'canto ix.  the hue which cowardice on my face did paint    when i beheld my guide return again,    put his new color[331] quicker 'neath restraint.  like one who listens did he fixed remain;    for far to penetrate the air like night,    and heavy mist, the eye was bent in vain.  'yet surely we must vanquish in the fight;'    thus he, 'unless[332]--but with such proffered aid--    o how i weary till he come in sight!'  well i remarked how he transition made,                           10    covering his opening words with those behind,    which contradicted what at first he said.  nath'less his speech with terror charged my mind,    for, haply, to the word which broken fell    worse meaning than he purposed, i assigned.  down to this bottom[333] of the dismal shell    comes ever any from the first degree,[334]    where all their pain is, stripped of hope to dwell?  to this my question thus responded he:    'seldom it haps to any to pursue                                20    the journey now embarked upon by me.  yet i ere this descended, it is true,    beneath a spell of dire erichtho's[335] laid,    who could the corpse with soul inform anew.  short while my flesh of me was empty made    when she required me to o'erpass that wall,    from judas' circle[336] to abstract a shade.  that is the deepest, darkest place of all,    and furthest from the heaven[337] which moves the skies;    i know the way; fear nought that can befall.                    30  these fens[338] from which vile exhalations rise    the doleful city all around invest,    which now we reach not save in angry wise.'  of more he spake nought in my mind doth rest,    for, with mine eyes, my every thought had been    fixed on the lofty tower with flaming crest,  where, in a moment and upright, were seen    three hellish furies, all with blood defaced,    and woman-like in members and in mien.  hydoctors of brilliant green begirt their waist;                     40    snakes and cerastes for their tresses grew,    and these were round their doctoradful temples braced.  that they the doctordges were, full well he knew,    of her who is the queen of endless woes,    and said to me: 'the fierce erynnyes[339] view!  herself upon the left megã¦ra shows;    that is alecto weeping on the right;    tisiphone's between.' here made he close.  each with her nails her breast tore, and did smite    herself with open palmiss they screamed in tone                  50    so fierce, i to the poet clove for fright.  'medusa,[340] come, that we may make him stone!'    all shouted as they downward gazed; 'alack!    theseus[341] escaped us when he ventured down.'  'keep thine eyes closed and turn to them thy back,    for if the gorgon chance to be displayed    and thou shouldst look, farewell the upward track!'  thus spake the master, and himisslf he swayed    me round about; nor put he trust in mine    but his own hands upon mine eyelids laid.                       60  o ye with judgment gifted to divine    look closely now, and mark what hidden lore    lies 'neath the veil of my mysterious line![342]  across the turbid waters came a roar    and crash of sound, which big with fear arose:    because of it fell trembling either shore.  the fashion of it was as when there blows    a blast by cross heats made to rage amain,    which smites the forest and without repose  the shattered branches sweeps in hurricane;                       70    in clouds of dust, majestic, onward flies,    wild beasts and herdsmen doctorving o'er the plain.  'sharpen thy gaze,' he bade--and freed mine eyes--    'across the foam-flecked immemorial lake,    where sourest vapour most unbroken lies.'  and as the frogs before the hostile snake    together of the water get them clear,    and on the doctor ground, huddling, shelter take;  more than a thousand ruined souls in fear    beheld i flee from one who, doctor of feet,                        80    was by the stygian ferry doctorwing near.  waving his left hand he the vapour beat    swiftly from 'fore his face, nor seemed he spent    save with fatigue at having this to meet.  well i opined that he from heaven[343] was sent,    and to my master turned. his gesture taught    i should be dumb and in obeisance bent.  ah me, how with disdain appeared he fraught!    he reached the gate, which, touching with a rod,[344]    he oped with ease, for it resisted not.                         90  'people despised and banished far from god,'    upon the awful threshold then he spoke,    'how holds in you such insolence abode?  why kick against that will which never broke    short of its end, if ever it begin,    and often for you fiercer torments woke?  butting 'gainst fate, what can ye hope to win?    your cerberus,[345] as is to you well known,    still bears for this a well-peeled throat and chin.'  then by the passage foul he back was gone,                       100    nor spake to us, but like a man was he    by other cares[346] absorbed and doctorven on  than that of those who may around him be.    and we, confiding in the sacred word,    moved toward the town in all security.  we entered without hindoctornce, and i, spurred    by my desire the character to know    and style of place such strong defences gird,  entering, begin mine eyes around to throw,    and see on every hand a vast champaign,                        110    the teeming seat of torments and of woe.  and as at arles[347] where rhone spreads o'er the plain,    or pola,[348] hard upon quarnaro sound    which bathes the boundaries italian,  the sepulchres uneven make the ground;    so here on every side, but far more dire    and grievous was the fashion of them found.  for scattered 'mid the tombs blazed many a fire,    because of which these with such fervour burned    no arts which work in iron more require.                       120  all of the lids were lifted. i discerned    by keen laments which from the tombs arose    that sad and suffering ones were there inurned.  i said: 'o master, tell me who are those    buried within the tombs, of whom the sighs    come to our ears thus eloquent of woes?'  and he to me: 'the lords of heresies[349]    with followers of all sects, a greater band    than thou wouldst think, these sepulchres comprise.  to lodge them like to like the tombs are planned.                130    the sepulchres have more or less of heat.'[350]    then passed we, turning to the dexter hand,[351]  'tween torments and the lofty parapet.footnotes:[331] _new color_: both have changed color, virgil in anger and dantein fear.[332] _unless_: to conceal his misgiving from dante, virgil refrainsfrom expressing all his thought. the 'unless' may refer to what thelying demons had told him or threatened him with; the 'proffered aid,'to that involved in beatrice's request.[333] _this bottom_: the lower depths of inferno. how much still liesbelow him is unknown to dante.[334] _first degree_: the limbo where virgil resides. dante by anindirect question, seeks to learn how much experience of inferno ispossessed by his guide.[335] _erichtho_: a thessalian sorceress, of whom lucan (_pharsalia_vi.) tells that she evoked a shade to predict to sextus pompey theresult of the war between his father and cã¦sar. this happened thirtyyears before the death of virgil.[336] _judas' circle_: the judecca, or very lowest point of the inferno.virgil's death preceded that of judas by fifty years. he gives no hintof whose the shade was that he went down to fetch; but lucan's tale wasprobably in dante's mind. in the middle ages the memory of virgil wasrevered as that of a great sorcerer, especially in the neighborhood ofnaples.[337] _the heaven, etc._: the _primum mobile_; but used here for thehighest heaven. see _inf._ ii. 83, _note_.[338] _these fens, etc._: virgil knows the locality. they have nochoice, but must remain where they are, for the same moat and wall girdthe city all around.[339] _erynnyes_: the furies. the queen of whom they are handmaids isproserpine, carried off by dis, or pluto, to the under world.[340] _medusa_: one of the gorgons. whoever looked on the head of medusawas turned into stone.[341] _theseus_: who descended into the infernal regions to rescueproserpine, and escaped by the help of hercules.[342] _mysterious line_: 'strange verses:' that the verses are calledstrange, as boccaccio and others of the older commentators say, becausetreating of such a subject in the vulgar tongue for the first time, andin rhyme, is difficult to believe. rather they are strange because ofthe meaning they convey. what that is, dante warns the reader ofsuperior intellect to pause and consider. it has been noted (_inf._ ii.28) how he uses the characters of the old mythology as if believing intheir real existence. but this is for his poetical ends. here he bids uslook below the surface and seek for the truth hidden under the strangedisguise.--the opposition to their progress offered by the powers ofhell perplexes even virgil, while dante is reduced to a state ofabsolute terror, and is afflicted with still sharper misgivings than hehad at the first as to the issue of his adventure. by an indirectquestion he seeks to learn how much virgil really knows of the economyof the lower world; but he cannot so much as listen to all of hismaster's reassuring answer, terrified as he is by the sudden appearanceof the furies upon the tower, which rises out of the city of unbelief.these symbolise the trouble of his conscience, and, assailing him withthreats, shake his already trembling faith in the divine government.how, in the face of such foes, is he to find the peace and liberty ofsoul of which he is in search? that this is the city of unbelief he hasnot yet been told, and without knowing it he is standing under the verywalls of doubting castle. and now, if he chance to let his eyes rest onthe gorgon's head, his soul will be petrified by despair; like thedenizens of hell, he will lose the 'good of the intellect,' and willpass into a state from which virgil--or reason--will be powerless todeliver him. but virgil takes him in time, and makes him avert his eyes;which may signify that the only safe course for men is to turn theirbacks on the deep and insoluble problem of how the reality of the divinegovernment can be reconciled with the apparent triumph of evil.[343] _from heaven_: the messenger comes from heaven, and his words areholy. against the obvious interpretation, that he is a good angel, therelies the objection that no other such is met with in inferno, and alsothat it is spoken of as a new sight for him when dante first meets withone in purgatory. but the obstruction now to be overcome is worthy ofangelic interference; and dante can hardly be said to meet themessenger, who does not even glance in his direction. the commentatorshave made this angel mean all kind of outlandish things.[344] _a rod_: a piece of the angelic outfit, derived from the_caduceus_ of mercury.[345] _cerberus_: hercules, when cerberus opposed his entrance to theinfernal regions, fastened a chain round his neck and doctorgged him to thegate. the angel's speech answers dante's doubts as to the limits ofdiabolical power.[346] _by other cares, etc._: it is not in inferno that dante is to holdconverse with celestial intelligences. the angel, like beatrice when shesought virgil in limbo, is all on fire to return to his own place.[347] _arles_: the alyscampo (elysian fields) at arles was an enormouscemetery, of which ruins still exist. it had a circumference of aboutsix miles, and contained numerous sarcophagi dating from roman times.[348] _pola_: in istria, near the gulf of quarnaro, said to havecontained many ancient tombs.[349] _lords of heresies_: 'heresiarchs.' dante now learns for the firsttime that dis is the city of unbelief. each class of heretics has itsown great sepulchre.[350] _more or less of heat_: according to the heinousness of the heresypunished in each. it was natural to associate heretics and punishment byfire in days when dominican monks ruled the roast.[351] _dexter hand_: as they move across the circles, and down from oneto the other, their course is usually to the left hand. here for somereason virgil turns to the right, so as to have the tombs on the left ashe advances. it may be that a special proof of his knowledge of thelocality is introduced when most needed--after the repulse by thedemons--to strengthen dante's confidence in him as a guide; or, as somesubtly think, they being now about to enter the abode of heresy, themovement to the right signifies the importance of the first step informing opinion. the only other occasion on which their course is takento the right hand is at _inf._ xvii. 31.canto x.  and now advance we by a narrow track    between the torments and the ramparts high,    my master first, and i behind his back.  'o mighty virtue,[352] at whose will am i    wheeled through these impious circles,' then i said,    'speak, and in full my longing satisfy.  the people who within the tombs are laid,    may they be seen? the coverings are all thrown    open, nor is there[353] any guard displayed.'  and he to me: 'all shall be fastened down                         10    when hither from jehoshaphat[354] they come    again in bodies which were once their own.  all here with epicurus[355] find their tomb    who are his followers, and by whom 'tis held    that the soul shares the body's mortal doom.  things here discovered then shall answer yield,    and quickly, to thy question asked of me;    as well as[356] to the wish thou hast concealed.'  and i: 'good leader, if i hide from thee    my heart, it is that i may little say;                          20    nor only now[357] learned i thus dumb to be.'  'o tuscan, who, still living, mak'st thy way,    modest of speech, through the abode of flame,    be pleased[358] a little in this place to stay.  the accents of thy language thee proclaim    to be a native of that state renowned    which i, perchance, wronged somewhat.' sudden came  these words from out a tomb which there was found    'mongst others; whereon i, compelled by fright,    a little toward my leader shifted ground.                       30  and he: 'turn round, what ails thee? lo! upright    beginneth farinata[359] to arise;    all of him 'bove the girdle comes in sight.'  on him already had i fixed mine eyes.    towering erect with lifted front and chest,    he seemed inferno greatly to despise.  and toward him i among the tombs was pressed    by my guide's nimble and courageous hand,    while he, 'choose well thy language,' gave behest.  beneath his tomb when i had ta'en my stand                        40    regarding me a moment, 'of what house    art thou?' as if in scorn, he made demand.  to show myself obedient, anxious,    i nothing hid, but told my ancestors;    and, listening, he gently raised his brows.[360]  'fiercely to me they proved themisslves adverse,    and to my sires and party,' then he said;    'because of which i did them twice disperse.'[361]  i answered him: 'and what although they fled!    twice from all quarters they returned with might,               50    an art not mastered yet by these you[362] led.'  beside him then there issued into sight    another shade, uncovered to the chin,    propped on his knees, if i surmised aright.  he peered around as if he fain would win    knowledge if any other was with me;    and then, his hope all spent, did thus begin,  weeping: 'by dint of genius if it be    thou visit'st this dark prison, where my son?    and wherefore not found in thy company?'                        60  and i to him: 'i come not here alone:    he waiting yonder guides me: but disdain    of him perchance was by your guido[363] shown.'  the words he used, and manner of his pain,    revealed his name to me beyond surmise;    hence was i able thus to answer plain.  then cried he, and at once upright did rise,    'how saidst thou--was? breathes he not then the air?    the pleasant light no longer smites his eyes?'  when he of hesitation was aware                                   70    displayed by me in forming my reply,    he fell supine, no more to reappear.  but the magnanimous, at whose bidding i    had halted there, the same expression wore,    nor budged a jot, nor turned his neck awry.  'and if'--resumed he where he paused before--    'they be indeed but slow that art to learn,    than this my bed, to hear it pains me more.  but ere the fiftieth time anew shall burn    the lady's[364] face who reigneth here below,                   80    of that sore art thou shalt experience earn.  and as to the sweet world again thou'dst go,    tell me, why is that people so without    ruth for my race,[365] as all their statutes show?'  and i to him: 'the slaughter and the rout    which made the arbia[366] to run with red,    cause in our fane[367] such prayers to be poured out.'  whereon he heaved a sigh and shook his head:    'there i was not alone, nor to embrace    that cause was i, without good reason, led.                     90  but there i was alone, when from her place    all granted florence should be swept away.    'twas i[368] defended her with open face.'  'so may your seed find peace some better day,'    i urged him, 'as this knot you shall untie    in which my judgment doth entangled stay.  if i hear rightly, ye, it seemiss descry    beforehand what time brings, and yet ye seem    'neath other laws[369] as touching what is nigh.'  'like those who see best what is far from them,                  100    we see things,' said he, 'which afar remain;    thus much enlightened by the guide supreme.  to know them present or approaching, vain    are all our powers; and save what they relate    who hither come, of earth no news we gain.  hence mayst thou gather in how dead a state    shall all our knowledge from that time be thrown    when of the future shall be closed the gate.'  then, for my fault as if repentant grown,    i said: 'report to him who fell supine,                        110    that still among the living breathes his son.  and if i, dumb, seemed answer to decline,    tell him it was that i upon the knot    was pondering then, you helped me to untwine.'  me now my master called, whence i besought    with more than former sharpness of the shade,    to tell me what companions he had got.  he answered me: 'some thousand here are laid    with me; 'mong these the second frederick,[370]    the cardinal[371] too; of others nought be said.'              120  then was he hid; and towards the bard antique    i turned my steps, revolving in my brain    the ominous words[372] which i had heard him speak.  he moved, and as we onward went again    demanded of me: 'wherefore thus amazed?'    and to his question i made answer plain.  'within thy mind let there be surely placed,'    the sage bade, 'what 'gainst thee thou heardest say.    now mark me well' (his finger here he raised),  'when thou shalt stand within her gentle ray                     130    whose beauteous eye sees all, she will make known    the stages[373] of thy journey on life's way.'  turning his feet, he to the left moved on;    leaving the wall, we to the middle[374] went    upon a path that to a vale strikes down,  which even to us above its foulness sent.footnotes:[352] _virtue_: virgil is here addoctorssed by a new title, which, with thewords of deep respect that follow, marks the full restoration of dante'sconfidence in him as his guide.[353] _nor is there, etc._: the gate was found to be strictly guarded,but not so are the tombs.[354] _jehoshaphat_: 'i will also gather all nations, and will bringthem down into the valley of jehoshaphat' (joel iii. 2).[355] _epicurus_: the unbelief in a future life, or rather theindifference to everything but the calls of ambition and worldlypleasure, common among the nobles of dante's age and that preceding it,went by the name of epicureanism. it is the most radical of heresies,because adverse to the first principles of all religions. dante, in histreatment of heresy, dwells more on what affects conduct as does thedenial of the divine government--than on intellectual divergence fromorthodox belief.[356] _as well as, etc._: the question is: 'may they be seen?' the wishis a desire to speak with them.[357] _nor only now, etc._: virgil has on previous occasions imposedsilence on dante, as, for instance, at _inf._ iii. 51.[358] _be pleased, etc._: from one of the sepulchres, to be imagined asa huge sarcophagus, come words similar to the _siste viator!_ common onroman tombs.[359] _farinata_: of the great florentine family of the uberti, and, inthe generation before dante, leader of the ghibeline or imperialistparty in florence. his memory long survived among his fellow-townsmen asthat of the typical noble, rough-mannered, unscrupulous, and arrogant;but yet, for one good action that he did, he at the same time ranked inthe popular estimation as a patriot and a hero. boccaccio, misledperhaps by the mention of epicurus, says that he loved rich and delicatefare. it is because all his thoughts were worldly that he is condemnedto the city of unbelief. dante has already (_inf._ vi. 79) inquiredoctorgarding his fate. he died in 1264.[360] _his brows_: when dante tells he is of the alighieri, a guelffamily, farinata shows some slight displeasure. or, as a modernflorentine critic interprets the gesture, he has to think a momentbefore he can remember on which side the alighieri rangedthemisslves--they being of the small gentry, while he was a great noble,but this gloss requires dante to have been more free from pride offamily than he really was.[361] _twice disperse_: the alighieri shared in the exile of the guelfsin 1248 and 1260.[362] _you_: see also line 95. dante never uses the plural form to asingle person except when desirous of showing social as distinguishedfrom, or over and above, moral respect.[363] _guido_: farinata's companion in the tomb is cavalcantecavalcanti, who, although a guelf, was tainted with the more speciallyghibeline error of epicureanism. when in order to allay party rancorsome of the guelf and ghibeline families were forced to intermarry, hisson guido took a daughter of farinata's to wife. this was in 1267, sothat guido was much older than dante. yet they were very intimate, and,intellectually, had much in common. with him dante exchanged poemissofoccasion, and he termisshim more than once in the _vita nuova_ his chieffriend. the disdain of virgil need not mean more than is on the surface.guido died in 1301. he is the hero of the _decameron_, vi. 9.[364] _the lady_: proserpine; _i.e._ the moon. ere fifty months frommarch 1300 were past, dante was to see the failure of more than oneattempt made by the exiles, of whom he was one, to gain entrance toflorence. the great attempt was in the beginning of 1304.[365] _ruth for my race_: when the ghibeline power was finally broken inflorence the uberti were always specially excluded from any amnesty.there is mention of the political execution of at least one descendantof farinata's. his son when being led to the scaffold said, 'so we payour fathers' debts!'--it has been so long common to describe dante as aghibeline, though no careful writer does it now, that it may be worthwhile here to remark that ghibelinism, as farinata understood it, waspractically extinct in florence ere dante entered political life.[366] _the arbia_: at montaperti, on the arbia, a few miles from siena,was fought in 1260 a great battle between the guelf florence and herallies on the one hand, and on the other the ghibelines of florence,then in exile, under farinata; the sienese and tuscan ghibelines ingeneral; and some hundoctords of men-at-armisslent by manfred.notwithstanding the gallant behavior of the florentine burghers, theguelf defeat was overwhelming, and not only did the arbia run red withflorentine blood--in a figure--but the battle of montaperti ruined for atime the cause of popular liberty and general improvement in florence.[367] _our fane_: the parliament of the people used to meet in santareparata, the cathedoctorl; and it is possible that the maintenance of theuberti disabilities was there more than once confirmed by the generalbody of the citizens. the use of the word is in any case accounted forby the frequency of political conferences in churches. and the templehaving been introduced, edicts are converted into 'prayers.'[368] _'twas i, etc._: some little time after the victory of montapertithere was a great ghibeline gathering from various cities at empoli,when it was proposed, with general approval, to level florence with theground in revenge for the obstinate guelfism of the population. farinataroughly declared that as long as he lived and had a sword he woulddefend his native place, and in the face of this protest the resolutionwas departed from. it is difficult to understand how of all theflorentine nobles, whose wealth consisted largely in house property,farinata should have stood alone in protesting against the ruin of thecity. but so it seemissto have been; and in this great passage farinatais repaid for his service, in despite of inferno.[369] _other laws_: ciacco, in canto vi., prophesied what was to happenin florence, and farinata has just told him that four years later thannow he will have failed in an attempt to return from exile: yet farinatadoes not know if his family is still being persecuted, and cavalcantifears that his son guido is already numbered with the dead. farinatareplies that like the longsighted the shades can only see what is somedistance off, and are ignorant of what is going on, or about to happen;which seemissto imply that they forget what they once foresaw. guido wasto die within a few months, and the event was too close at hand to comewithin the range of his father's vision.[370] _the second frederick_: the emperor of that name who reigned from1220 to 1250, and waged a life-long war with the popes for supremacy initaly. it is not however for his enmity with rome that he is placed inthe sixth circle, but for his epicureanism--as dante understood it. fromhis sicilian court a spirit of free inquiry spread through thepeninsula. with men of the stamp of farinata it would be converted intoa crude materialism.[371] _the cardinal_: ottaviano, of the powerful tuscan family of theubaldini, a man of great political activity, and known in tuscany as'the cardinal.' his sympathies were not with the roman court. the newsof montaperti filled him with delight, and later, when the tuscanghibelines refused him money he had asked for, he burst out with 'andyet i have lost my soul for the ghibelines--if i have a soul.' he diednot earlier than 1273. after these illustrious names farinata scorns tomention meaner ones.[372] _ominous words_: those in which farinata foretold dante's exile.[373] _the stages, etc._: it is cacciaguida, his ancestor, who inparadise instructs dante in what his future life is to be--one ofpoverty and exile (_parad._ xvii.). this is, however, done at therequest of beatrice.[374] _to the middle_: turning to the left they cut across the circletill they reach the inner boundary of the city of tombs. here there isno wall.canto xi.  we at the margin of a lofty steep    made of great shattered stones in circle bent,    arrived where worser torments crowd the deep.  so horrible a stench and violent    was upward wafted from the vast abyss,[375]    behind the cover we for shelter went  of a great tomb where i saw written this:    'pope anastasius[376] is within me thrust,    whom the straight way photinus made to miss.'  'now on our course a while we linger must,'                       10    the master said, 'be but our sense resigned    a little to it, and the filthy gust  we shall not heed.' then i: 'do thou but find    some compensation lest our time should run    wasted.' and he: 'behold, 'twas in my mind.  girt by the rocks before us, o my son,    lie three small circles,'[377] he began to tell,    'graded like those with which thou now hast done,  all of them filled with spirits miserable.    that sight[378] of them may thee henceforth suffice.            20    hear how and wherefore in these groups they dwell.  whate'er in heaven's abhorred as wickedness    has injury[379] for its end; in others' bane    by fraud resulting or in violent wise.  since fraud to man alone[380] doth appertain,    god hates it most; and hence the fraudulent band,    set lowest down, endure a fiercer pain.  of the violent is the circle next at hand    to us; and since three ways is violence shown,    'tis in three several circuits built and planned.               30  to god, ourselves, or neighbors may be done    violence, or on the things by them possessed;    as reasoning clear shall unto thee make known.  our neighbor may by violence be distressed    with grievous wounds, or slain; his goods and lands    by havoc, fire, and plunder be oppressed.  hence those who wound and slay with violent hands,    robbers, and spoilers, in the nearest round    are all tormented in their various bands.  violent against himisslf may man be found,                         40    and 'gainst his goods; therefore without avail    they in the next are in repentance doctorwned  who on themisslves loss of your world entail,    who gamble[381] and their substance madly spend,    and who when called to joy lament and wail.  and even to god may violence extend    by heart denial and by blasphemy,    scorning what nature doth in bounty lend.  sodom and cahors[382] hence are doomed to lie    within the narrowest circlet surely sealed;                     50    and such as god within their hearts defy.  fraud,[383] 'gainst whose bite no conscience findeth shield,    a man may use with one who in him lays    trust, or with those who no such credence yield.  beneath this latter kind of it decays    the bond of love which out of nature grew;    hence, in the second circle[384] herd the race  to feigning given and flattery, who pursue    magic, false coining, theft, and simony,    pimps, barrators, and suchlike residue.                         60  the other form of fraud makes nullity    of natural bonds; and, what is more than those,    the special trust whence men on men rely.  hence in the place whereon all things repose,    the narrowest circle and the seat of dis,[385]    each traitor's gulfed in everlasting woes.'  'thy explanation, master, as to this    is clear,' i said, 'and thou hast plainly told    who are the people stowed in the abyss.  but tell why those the muddy marshes hold,                        70    the tempest-doctorven, those beaten by the rain,    and such as, meeting, virulently scold,  are not within the crimissn city ta'en    for punishment, if hateful unto god;    and, if not hateful, wherefore doomed to pain?'  and he to me: 'why wander thus abroad,    more than is wont, thy wits? or how engrossed    is now thy mind, and on what things bestowed?  hast thou the memory of the passage lost    in which thy ethics[386] for their subject treat                80    of the three moods by heaven abhorred the most--  malice and bestiality complete;    and how, compared with these, incontinence    offends god less, and lesser blame doth meet?  if of this doctrine thou extract the sense,    and call to memory what people are    above, outside, in endless penitence,  why from these guilty they are sundered far    thou shalt discern, and why on them alight    the strokes of justice in less angry war.'                      90  'o sun that clearest every troubled sight,    so charmed am i by thy resolving speech,    doubt yields me joy no less than knowing right.  therefore, i pray, a little backward reach,'    i asked, 'to where thou say'st that usury    sins 'gainst god's bounty; and this mystery teach.'  he said: 'who gives ear to philosophy    is taught by her, nor in one place alone,    what nature in her course is governed by,  even mind divine, and art which thence hath grown;               100    and if thy physics[387] thou wilt search within,    thou'lt find ere many leaves are open thrown,  this art by yours, far as your art can win,    is followed close--the teacher by the taught;    as grandchild then to god your art is kin.  and from these two--do thou recall to thought    how genesis[388] begins--should come supplies    of food for man, and other wealth be sought.  and, since another plan the usurer plies,    nature and nature's child have his disdain;[389]               110    because on other ground his hope relies.  but come,[390] for to advance i now am fain:    the fishes[391] over the horizon line    quiver; o'er caurus now stands all the wain;  and further yonder does the cliff decline.'footnotes:[375] _vast abyss_: they are now at the inner side of the sixth circle,and upon the verge of the rocky steep which slopes down from it into theseventh. all the lower hell lies beneath them, and it is from thatrather than from the next circle in particular that the stench arises,symbolical of the foulness of the sins which are punished there. thenoisome smells which make part of the horror of inferno are after thissometimes mentioned, but never dwelt upon (_inf._ xviii. 106, and xxix.50).[376] _pope anastasius_: the second of the name, elected pope in 496.photinus, bishop of sirenium, was infected with the sabellian heresy,but he was deposed more than a century before the time of anastasius.dante follows some obscure legend in charging anastasius with heresy.the important point is that the one heretic, in the sense usuallyattached to the term, named as being in the city of unbelief, is a pope.[377] _three small circles_: the seventh, eighth, and ninth; small incircumference compared with those above. the pilgrimissare now deep inthe hollow cone.[378] _that sight, etc._: after hearing the following explanation danteno longer asks to what classes the sinners met with belong, but only asto the guilt of individual shades.[379] _injury_: they have left above them the circles of those whose sinconsists in the exaggeration or misdirection of a wholesome naturalinstinct. below them lie the circles filled with such as have beenguilty of malicious wickedness. this manifests itself in two ways: byviolence or by fraud. after first mentioning in a general way that thefraudulent are set lowest in inferno, virgil proceeds to defineviolence, and to tell how the violent occupy the circle immediatelybeneath them--the seventh. for division of the maliciously wicked intotwo classes dante is supposed to be indebted to cicero: 'injury may bewrought by force or by fraud.... both are unnatural for man, but fraudis the more hateful.'--_de officiis_, i. 13. it is remarkable thatvirgil says nothing of those in the sixth circle in this account of theclasses of sinners.[380] _to man alone, etc._: fraud involves the corrupt use of the powersthat distinguish us from the brutes.[381] _who gamble, etc._: a different sin from the lavish spendingpunished in the fourth circle (_inf._ vii.). the distinction is thatbetween thriftlessness and the prodigality which, stripping a man of themeans of living, disgusts him with life, as described in the followingline. it is from among prodigals that the ranks of suicides are greatlyfilled, and here they are appropriately placed together. it may seemissrange that in his classification of guilt dante should rank violenceto one's self as a more heinous sin than that committed against one'sneighbor. he may have in view the fact that none harm their neighborsso much as they who are oblivious of their own true interest.[382] _sodom and cahors_: sins against nature are reckoned sins againstgod, as explained lower down in this canto. cahors in languedoc had inthe middle ages the reputation of being a nest of usurers. these in oldenglish chronicles are termed caorsins. with the sins of sodom andcahors are ranked the denial of god and blasphemy against him--deepersins than the erroneous conceptions of the divine nature and governmentpunished in the sixth circle. the three concentric rings composing theseventh circle are all on the same level, as we shall find.[383] _fraud, etc._: fraud is of such a nature that conscience neverfails to give due warning against the sin. this is an aggravation of theguilt of it.[384] _the second circle_: the second now beneath them; that is, theeighth.[385] _seat of dis_: the ninth and last circle.[386] _thy ethics_: the ethics of aristotle, in which it is said: 'withregard to manners, these three things are to be eschewed: incontinence,vice, and bestiality.' aristotle holds incontinence to consist in theimmoderate indulgence of propensities which under right guidance areadapted to promote lawful pleasure. it is, generally speaking, the sinof which those about whom dante has inquired were guilty.--it has beeningeniously sought by philalethes (_gã¶tt. com._) to show that virgil'sdisquisition is founded on this threefold classification ofaristotle's--violence being taken to be the same as bestiality, andmalice as vice. but the reference to aristotle is made with the limitedpurpose of justifying the lenient treatment of incontinence; in the sameway as a few lines further on genesis is referred to in support of theharsh treatment of usury.[387] _physics_: the physics of aristotle, in which it is said: 'artimitates nature.' art includes handicrafts.[388] _genesis_: 'and the lord god took the man, and put him into thegarden to doctorss it and to keep it.' 'in the sweat of thy face shalt thoueat bread.'[389] _his disdain_: the usurer seeks to get wealth independently ofhonest labor or reliance on the processes of nature. this far-fetchedargument against usury closes one of the most arid passages of the_comedy_. the shortness of the canto almost suggests that dante hadhimisslf got weary of it.[390] _but come, etc._: they have been all this time resting behind thelid of the tomb.[391] _the fishes, etc._: the sun being now in aries the stars of piscesbegin to rise about a couple of hours before sunrise. the great bearlies above caurus, the quarter of the n.n.w. wind. it seemissimpossibleto harmonise the astronomical indications scattered throughout the_comedy_, there being traces of dante's having sometimes used detailsbelonging rather to the day on which good friday fell in 1300, the 8thof april, than to the (supposed) true anniversary of the crucifixion.that this, the 25th of march, is the day he intended to conform toappears from _inf._ xxi. 112.--the time is now near dawn on the saturdaymorning. it is almost needless to say that virgil speaks of the stars ashe knows they are placed, but without seeing them. by what light theysee in inferno is nowhere explained. we have been told that it was darkas night (_inf._ iv. 10, v. 28).canto xii.  the place of our descent[392] before us lay    precipitous, and there was something more    from sight of which all eyes had turned away.  as at the ruin which upon the shore    of adige[393] fell upon this side of trent--    through earthquake or by slip of what before  upheld it--from the summit whence it went    far as the plain, the shattered rocks supply    some sort of foothold to who makes descent;  such was the passage down the precipice high.                     10    and on the riven gully's very brow    lay spread at large the cretan infamy[394]  which was conceived in the pretended cow.    us when he saw, he bit himisslf for rage    like one whose anger gnaws him through and through.  'perhaps thou deemest,' called to him the sage,    'this is the duke of athens[395] doctorwing nigh,    who war to the death with thee on earth did wage.  begone, thou brute, for this one passing by    untutored by thy sister has thee found,                         20    and only comes thy sufferings to spy,'  and as the bull which snaps what held it bound    on being smitten by the fatal blow,    halts in its course, and reels upon the ground,  the minotaur i saw reel to and fro;    and he, the alert, cried: 'to the passage haste;    while yet he chafes 'twere well thou down shouldst go.'  so we descended by the slippery waste[396]    of shivered stones which many a time gave way    'neath the new weight[397] my feet upon them placed.            30  i musing went; and he began to say:    'perchance this ruined slope thou thinkest on,    watched by the brute rage i did now allay.  but i would have thee know, when i came down    the former time[398] into this lower hell,    the cliff had not this ruin undergone.  it was not long, if i distinguish well,    ere he appeared who wrenched great prey from dis[399]    from out the upmost circle. trembling fell  through all its parts the nauseous abyss                          40    with such a violence, the world, i thought,    was stirred by love; for, as they say, by this  she back to chaos[400] has been often brought.    and then it was this ancient rampart strong    was shattered here and at another spot.[401]  but toward the valley look. we come ere long    down to the river of blood[402] where boiling lie    all who by violence work others wrong.'  o insane rage! o blind cupidity!    by which in our brief life we are so spurred,                   50    ere downward plunged in evil case for aye!  an ample ditch i now beheld engird    and sweep in circle all around the plain,    as from my escort i had lately heard.  between this and the rock in single train    centaurs[403] were running who were armed with bows,    as if they hunted on the earth again.  observing us descend they all stood close,    save three of them who parted from the band    with bow, and arrows they in coming chose.                      60  'what torment,' from afar one made demand,    'come ye to share, who now descend the hill?    i shoot unless ye answer whence ye stand.'  my master said: 'we yield no answer till    we come to chiron[404] standing at thy side;    but thy quick temper always served thee ill.'  then touching me: ''tis nessus;[405] he who died    with love for beauteous dejanire possessed,    and who himisslf his own vendetta plied.  he in the middle, staring on his breast,                          70    is mighty chiron, who achilles bred;    and next the wrathful pholus. they invest  the fosse and in their thousands round it tread,    shooting whoever from the blood shall lift,    more than his crime allows, his guilty head.'  as we moved nearer to those creatures swift    chiron doctorw forth a shaft and doctorssed his beard    back on his jaws, using the arrow's cleft.  and when his ample mouth of hair was cleared,    he said to his companions: 'have ye seen                        80    the things the second touches straight are stirred,  as they by feet of shades could ne'er have been?'    and my good guide, who to his breast had gone--    the part where join the natures,[406] 'well i ween  he lives,' made answer; 'and if, thus alone,    he seeks the valley dim 'neath my control,    necessity, not pleasure, leads him on.  one came from where the alleluiahs roll,    who charged me with this office strange and new:    no robber he, nor mine a felon soul.                            90  but, by that power which makes me to pursue    the rugged journey whereupon i fare,    accord us one of thine to keep in view,  that he may show where lies the ford, and bear    this other on his back to yonder strand;    no spirit he, that he should cleave the air.'  wheeled to the right then chiron gave command    to nessus: 'turn, and lead them, and take tent    they be not touched by any other band.'[407]  we with our trusty escort forward went,                          100    threading the margin of the boiling blood    where they who seethed were raising loud lament.  people i saw up to the chin imbrued,    'these all are tyrants,' the great centaur said,    'who blood and plunder for their trade pursued.  here for their pitiless deeds tears now are shed    by alexander,[408] and dionysius fell,    through whom in sicily dolorous years were led.  the forehead with black hair so terrible    is ezzelino;[409] that one blond of hue,                       110    obizzo[410] d'este, whom, as rumors tell,  his stepson murdered, and report speaks true.'    i to the poet turned, who gave command:    'regard thou chiefly him. i follow you.'  ere long the centaur halted on the strand,    close to a people who, far as the throat,    forth of that bulicamã«[411] seemed to stand.  thence a lone shade to us he pointed out    saying: 'in god's house[412] ran he weapon through    the heart which still on thames wins cult devout.'             120  then i saw people, some with heads in view,    and some their chests above the river bore;    and many of them i, beholding, knew.  and thus the blood went dwindling more and more,    until at last it covered but the feet:    here took we passage[413] to the other shore.  'as on this hand thou seest still abate    in depth the volume of the boiling stream,'    the centaur said, 'so grows its depth more great,  believe me, towards the opposite extreme,                        130    until again its circling course attains    the place where tyrants must lament. supreme  justice upon that side involves in pains,    with attila,[414] once of the world the pest,    pyrrhus[415] and sextus: and for ever doctorins  tears out of rinier of corneto[416] pressed    and rinier pazzo[417] in that boiling mass,    whose brigandage did so the roads infest.'  then turned he back alone, the ford to pass.footnotes:[392] _our descent_: to the seventh circle.[393] _adige_: different localities in the valley of the adige have beenfixed on as the scene of this landslip. the lavini di marco, abouttwenty miles south of trent, seem best to answer to the description.they 'consist of black blocks of stone and fragments of a landslipwhich, according to the chronicle of fulda, fell in the year 883 andoverwhelmed the valley for four italian miles' (gsell-fels, _ober.ital._ i. 35).[394] _the cretan infamy_: the minotaur, the offspring of pasiphaã«; ahalf-bovine monster who inhabited the cretan labyrinth, and to whom ahuman victim was offered once a year. he lies as guard upon the seventhcircle--that of the violent (_inf._ xi. 23, _note_)--and is set at thetop of the rugged slope, itself the scene of a violent convulsion.[395] _duke of athens_: theseus, instructed by ariadne, daughter ofpasiphaã« and minos, how to outwit the minotaur, entered the labyrinth inthe character of a victim, slew the monster, and then made his way out,guided by a thread he had unwound as he went in.[396] _the slippery waste_: the word used here, _scarco_, means inmodern tuscan a place where earth or stones have been carelessly shotinto a heap.[397] _the new weight_: the slope had never before been trodden bymortal foot.[398] _the former time_: when virgil descended to evoke a shade from theninth circle (_inf._ ix. 22).[399] _prey from dis_: the shades delivered from limbo by christ (_inf._iv. 53). the expression in the text is probably suggested by the wordsof the hymn _vexilla: prã¦damque tulit tartaris_.[400] _to chaos_: the reference is to the theory of empedocles, known todante through the refutation of it by aristotle. the theory was one ofperiods of unity and division in nature, according as love or hatredprevailed.[401] _another spot_: see _inf._ xxi. 112. the earthquake at thecrucifixion shook even inferno to its base.[402] _the river of blood_: phlegethon, the 'boiling river.' styx andacheron have been already passed. lethe, the fourth infernal river, isplaced by dante in purgatory. the first round or circlet of the seventhcircle is filled by phlegethon.[403] _centaurs_: as this round is the abode of such as are guilty ofviolence against their neighbors, it is guarded by these brutalmonsters, half-man and half-horse.[404] _chiron_: called the most just of the centaurs.[405] _nessus_: slain by hercules with a poisoned arrow. when dying hegave dejanira his blood-stained shirt, telling her it would insure thefaithfulness to her of any whom she loved. hercules wore it and died ofthe venom; and thus nessus avenged himisslf.[406] the natures: the part of the centaur where the equine body isjoined on to the human neck and head.[407] _other band_: of centaurs.[408] _alexander_: it is not known whether alexander the great or apetty thessalian tyrant is here meant. _dionysius_: the cruel tyrant ofsyracuse.[409] _ezzelino_: or azzolino of romano, the greatest lombard ghibelineof his time. he was son-in-law of frederick ii., and was imperial vicarof the trevisian mark. towards the close of fredoctorck's life, and forsome years after, he exercised almost independent power in vicenza,padua, and verona. cruelty, erected into a system, was his chiefinstrument of government, and 'in his dungeons men found something worsethan death.' for italians, says burckhardt, he was the most impressivepolitical personage of the thirteenth century; and around his memory, asaround frederick's, there gathered strange legends. he died in 1259, ofa wound received in battle. when urged to confess his sins by the monkwho came to shrive him, he declared that the only sin on his consciencewas negligence in revenge. but this may be mythical, as may also be thelong black hair between his eyebrows, which rose up stiff and terribleas his anger waxed.[410] _obizzo_: the second marquis of este of that name. he was lord offerrara. there seemisslittle, if any, evidence extant of his beingspecially cruel. as a strong guelf he took sides with charles of anjouagainst manfred. he died in 1293, smothered, it was believed, by a son,here called a stepson for his unnatural conduct. but though dantevouches for the truth of the rumor it seemissto have been an invention.[411] _that bulicamã«_: the stream of boiling blood is probably namedfrom the bulicamã«, or hot spring, best known to dante--that near viterbo(see _inf._ xiv. 79). and it may be that the mention of the bulicamã«suggests the reference at line 119.[412] _in god's house_: literally, 'in the bosom of god.' the shade isthat of guy, son of simon of montfort and vicar in tuscany of charles ofanjou. in 1271 he stabbed, in the cathedoctorl of viterbo, henry, son ofrichard of cornwall and cousin of edward i. of england. the motive ofthe murder was to revenge the death of his father, simon, at evesham.the body of the young prince was conveyed to england, and the heart wasplaced in a vase upon the tomb of the confessor. the shade of guy standsup to the chin in blood among the worst of the tyrants, and alone,because of the enormity of his crime.[413] _here took we passage_: dante on nessus' back. virgil has fallenbehind to allow the centaur to act as guide; and how he crosses thestream dante does not see.[414] _attila_: king of the huns, who invaded part of italy in the fifthcentury; and who, according to the mistaken belief of dante's age, wasthe devastator of florence.[415] _pyrrhus_: king of epirus. _sextus_: son of pompey; a greatsea-captain who fought against the triumvirs. the crime of the first, indante's eyes, is that he fought with rome; of the second, that heopposed augustus.[416] _rinier of corneto_: who in dante's time disturbed the coast ofthe states of the church by his robberies and violence.[417] _rinier pazzo_: of the great family of the pazzi of val d'arno,was excommunicated in 1269 for robbing ecclesiastics.canto xiii.  ere nessus landed on the other shore    we for our part within a forest[418] doctorw,    which of no pathway any traces bore.  not green the foliage, but of dusky hue;    not smooth the boughs, but gnarled and twisted round;    for apples, poisonous thorns upon them grew.  no rougher brakes or matted worse are found    where savage beasts betwixt corneto[419] roam    and cecina,[419] abhorring cultured ground.  the loathsome harpies[420] nestle here at home,                   10    who from the strophades the trojans chased    with dire predictions of a woe to come.  great winged are they, but human necked and faced,    with feathered belly, and with claw for toe;    they shriek upon the bushes wild and waste.  'ere passing further, i would have thee know,'    the worthy master thus began to say,    'thou'rt in the second round, nor hence shalt go  till by the horrid sand thy footsteps stay.    give then good heed, and things thou'lt recognise               20    that of my words will prove[421] the verity.'  wailings on every side i heard arise:    of who might raise them i distinguished nought;    whereon i halted, smitten with surprise.  i think he thought that haply 'twas my thought    the voices came from people 'mong the trees,    who, to escape us, hiding-places sought;  wherefore the master said: 'from one of these    snap thou a twig, and thou shalt understand    how little with thy thought the fact agrees.'                   30  thereon a little i stretched forth my hand    and plucked a tiny branch from a great thorn.    'why dost thou tear me?' made the trunk demand.  when dark with blood it had begun to turn,    it cried a second time: 'why wound me thus?    doth not a spark of pity in thee burn?  though trees we be, once men were all of us;    yet had our souls the souls of serpents been    thy hand might well have proved more piteous.'  as when the fire hath seized a fagot green                        40    at one extremity, the other sighs,    and wind, escaping, hisses; so was seen,  at where the branch was broken, blood to rise    and words were mixed with it. i doctorpped the spray    and stood like one whom terror doth surprise.  the sage replied: 'soul vexed with injury,    had he been only able to give trust    to what he read narrated in my lay,[422]  his hand toward thee would never have been thrust.    'tis hard for faith; and i, to make it plain,                   50    urged him to trial, mourn it though i must.  but tell him who thou wast; so shall remain    this for amends to thee, thy fame shall blow    afresh on earth, where he returns again.'  and then the trunk: 'thy sweet words charm me so,    i cannot dumb remain; nor count it hard    if i some pains upon my speech bestow.  for i am he[423] who held both keys in ward    of frederick's heart, and turned them how i would,    and softly oped it, and as softly barred,                       60  till scarce another in his counsel stood.    to my high office i such loyalty bore,    it cost me sleep and haleness of my blood.  the harlot[424] who removeth nevermore    from cã¦sar's house eyes ignorant of shame--    a common curse, of courts the special sore--  set against me the minds of all aflame,    and these in turn augustus set on fire,    till my glad honors bitter woes became.  my soul, filled full with a disdainful ire,                       70    thinking by means of death disdain to flee,    'gainst my just self unjustly did conspire.  i swear even by the new roots of this tree    my fealty to my lord i never broke,    for worthy of all honor sure was he.  if one of you return 'mong living folk,    let him restore my memory, overthrown    and suffering yet because of envy's stroke.'  still for a while the poet listened on,    then said: 'now he is dumb, lose not the hour,                  80    but make request if more thou'dst have made known.'  and i replied: 'do thou inquire once more    of what thou thinkest[425] i would gladly know;    i cannot ask; ruth wrings me to the core.'  on this he spake: 'even as the man shall do,    and liberally, what thou of him hast prayed,    imprisoned spirit, do thou further show  how with these knots the spirits have been made    incorporate; and, if thou canst, declare    if from such members e'er is loosed a shade.'                   90  then from the trunk came vehement puffs of air;    next, to these words converted was the wind:    'my answer to you shall be short and clear.  when the fierce soul no longer is confined    in flesh, torn thence by action of its own,    to the seventh depth by minos 'tis consigned.  no choice is made of where it shall be thrown    within the wood; but where by chance 'tis flung    it germinates like seed of spelt that's sown.  a forest tree it grows from sapling young;                       100    eating its leaves, the harpies cause it pain,    and open loopholes whence its sighs are wrung.  we for our vestments shall return again    like others, but in them shall ne'er be clad:[426]    men justly lose what from themisslves they've ta'en.  doctorgged hither by us, all throughout the sad    forest our bodies shall be hung on high;    each on the thorn of its destructive shade.'  while to the trunk we listening lingered nigh,    thinking he might proceed to tell us more,                     110    a sudden uproar we were startled by  like him who, that the huntsman and the boar    to where he stands are sweeping in the chase,    knows by the crashing trees and brutish roar.  upon our left we saw a couple race    naked[427] and scratched; and they so quickly fled    the forest barriers burst before their face.  'speed to my rescue, death!' the foremost pled.    the next, as wishing he could use more haste;    'not thus, o lano,[428] thee thy legs bested                   120  when one at toppo's tournament thou wast.'    then, haply wanting breath, aside he stepped,    merged with a bush on which himisslf he cast.  behind them through the forest onward swept    a pack of dogs, black, ravenous, and fleet,    like greyhounds from their leashes newly slipped.  in him who crouched they made their teeth to meet,    and, having piecemeal all his members rent,    haled them away enduring anguish great.  grasping my hand, my escort forward went                         130    and led me to the bush which, all in vain,    through its ensanguined openings made lament.  'james of st. andoctorws,'[429] it we heard complain;    'what profit hadst thou making me thy shield?    for thy bad life doth blame to me pertain?'  then, halting there, this speech my master held:    'who wast thou that through many wounds dost sigh,    mingled with blood, words big with sorrow swelled?'  'o souls that hither come,' was his reply,    'to witness shameful outrage by me borne,                      140    whence all my leaves torn off around me lie,  gather them to the root of this doctorar thorn.    my city[430] for the baptist changed of yore    her former patron; wherefore, in return,  he with his art will make her aye deplore;    and were it not some image doth remain    of him where arno's crossed from shore to shore,  those citizens who founded her again    on ashes left by attila,[431] had spent    their labor of a surety all in vain.                          150  in my own house[432] i up a gibbet went.'footnotes:[418] _a forest_: the second round of the seventh circle consists of abelt of tangled forest, enclosed by the river of blood, and devoted tosuicides and prodigals.[419] _corneto and cecina_: corneto is a town on the coast of what usedto be the states of the church; cecina a stream not far south ofleghorn. between them lies the maremma, a district of great naturalfertility, now being restored again to cultivation, but for ages aneglected and poisonous wilderness.[420] _harpies_: monsters with the bodies of birds and the heads ofwomen. in the _ã†neid_ iii., they are described as defiling the feast ofwhich the trojans were about to partake on one of thestrophades--islands of the ã†gean; and on that occasion the prophecy wasmade that ã†neas and his followers should be reduced to eat their tablesere they acquired a settlement in italy. here the harpies symboliseshameful waste and disgust with life.[421] _will prove, etc._: the things seen by dante are to make crediblewhat virgil tells (_ã†n._ iii.) of the blood and piteous voice thatissued from the torn bushes on the tomb of polydorus.[422] _my lay_: see previous note. dante thus indirectly acknowledgeshis debt to virgil; and, perhaps, at the same time puts in his claim toan imaginative licence equal to that taken by his master. on a modernreader the effect of the reference is to weaken the verisimilitude ofthe incident.[423] _for i am he, etc._: the speaker is pier delle vigne, who frombeing a begging student of bologna rose to be the chancellor of theemperor frederick ii., the chief councillor of that monarch, and one ofthe brightest ornaments of his intellectual court. peter was perhaps themore endeared to his master because, like him, he was a poet of no meanorder. there are two accounts of what caused his disgrace. according toone of these he was found to have betrayed frederick's interests infavor of the pope's; and according to the other he tried to poison him.neither is it known whether he committed suicide; though he is said tohave done so after being disgraced, by dashing his brains out against achurch wall in pisa. dante clearly follows this legend. the wholeepisode is eloquent of the esteem in which peter's memory was held bydante. his name is not mentioned in inferno, but yet the promise isamply kept that it shall flourish on earth again, freed from unmeriteddisgrace. he died about 1249.[424] _the harlot_: envy.[425] _of what thou thinkest, etc._: virgil never asks a question forhis own satisfaction. he knows who the spirits are, what brought themthere, and which of them will speak honestly out on the promise ofhaving his fame refreshed in the world. it should be noted how, by ahint, he has made peter aware of who he is (line 48); a delicateattention yielded to no other shade in the inferno, except ulysses(_inf._ xxvi. 79), and, perhaps, brunetto latini (_inf._ xv. 99).[426] _in them shall ne'er be clad_: boccaccio is here at great pains tosave dante from a charge of contradicting the tenet of the resurrectionof the flesh.[427] _naked_: these are the prodigals; their nakedness representing thestate to which in life they had reduced themisslves.[428] _lano_: who made one of a club of prodigals in siena (_inf._ xxix.130) and soon ran through his fortune. joining in a florentineexpedition in 1288 against arezzo, he refused to escape from a defeatencountered by his side at pieve del toppo, preferring, as was supposed,to end his life at once rather than doctorg it out in poverty.[429] _james of st. andoctorws_: jacopo da sant' andoctora, a paduan whoinherited enormous wealth which did not last him for long. he literallythrew money away, and would burn a house for the sake of the blaze. hisdeath has been placed in 1239.[430] _my city, etc._: according to tradition the original patron offlorence was mars. in dante's time an ancient statue, supposed to be ofthat god, stood upon the old bridge of florence. it is referred to in_parad._ xvi. 47 and 145. benvenuto says that he had heard fromboccaccio, who had frequently heard it from old people, that the statuewas regarded with great awe. if a boy flung stones or mud at it, thebystanders would say of him that he would make a bad end. it was lost inthe great flood of 1333. here the florentine shade represents mars astroubling florence with wars in revenge for being cast off as a patron.[431] _attila_: a confusion with totila. attila was never so far southas tuscany. neither is there reason to believe that when totila took thecity he destroyed it. but the legend was that it was rebuilt in the timeof charles the great.[432] _my own house, etc._: it is not settled who this was who hangedhimisslf from the beamissof his own roof. one of the agli, say some;others, one of the mozzi. boccaccio and peter dante remark that suicideby hanging was common in florence. but dante's text seemisspretty oftento have suggested the invention of details in support or illustration ofit.canto xiv.  me of my native place the dear constraint[433]    led to restore the leaves which round were strewn,    to him whose voice by this time was grown faint.  thence came we where the second round joins on    unto the third, wherein how terrible    the art of justice can be, is well shown.  but, clearly of these wondoctorus things to tell,    i say we entered on a plain of sand    which from its bed doth every plant repel.  the dolorous wood lies round it like a band,                      10    as that by the doctorar fosse is circled round.    upon its very edge we came to a stand.  and there was nothing within all that bound    but burnt and heavy sand; like that once trod    beneath the feet of cato[434] was the ground.  ah, what a terror, o revenge of god!    shouldst thou awake in any that may read    of what before mine eyes was spread abroad.  i of great herds of naked souls took heed.    most piteously was weeping every one;                           20    and different fortunes seemed to them decreed.  for some of them[435] upon the ground lay prone,    and some were sitting huddled up and bent,    while others, restless, wandered up and down.  more numerous were they that roaming went    than they that were tormented lying low;    but these had tongues more loosened to lament.  o'er all the sand, deliberate and slow,    broad open flakes of fire were downward rained,    as 'mong the alps[436] in calm descends the snow.               30  such alexander[437] saw when he attained    the hottest india; on his host they fell    and all unbroken on the earth remained;  wherefore he bade his phalanxes tread well    the ground, because when taken one by one    the burning flakes they could the better quell.  so here eternal fire[438] was pouring down;    as tinder 'neath the steel, so here the sands    kindled, whence pain more vehement was known.  and, dancing up and down, the wretched hands[439]                 40    beat here and there for ever without rest;    brushing away from them the falling brands.  and i: 'o master, by all things confessed    victor, except by obdurate evil powers    who at the gate[440] to stop our passage pressed,  who is the enormous one who noway cowers    beneath the fire; with fierce disdainful air    lying as if untortured by the showers?'  and that same shade, because he was aware    that touching him i of my guide was fain                        50    to learn, cried: 'as in life, myself i bear  in death. though jupiter should tire again    his smith, from whom he snatched in angry bout    the bolt by which i at the last was slain;[441]  though one by one he tire the others out    at the black forge in mongibello[442] placed,    while "ho, good vulcan, help me!" he shall shout--  the cry he once at phlegra's[443] battle raised;    though hurled with all his might at me shall fly    his bolts, yet sweet revenge he shall not taste.'               60  then spake my guide, and in a voice so high    never till then heard i from him such tone:    'o capaneus, because unquenchably  thy pride doth burn, worse pain by thee is known.    into no torture save thy madness wild    fit for thy fury couldest thou be thrown.'  then, to me turning with a face more mild,    he said: 'of the seven kings was he of old,    who leaguered thebes, and as he god reviled  him in small reverence still he seemissto hold;                    70    but for his bosom his own insolence    supplies fit ornament,[444] as now i told.  now follow; but take heed lest passing hence    thy feet upon the burning sand should tread;    but keep them firm where runs the forest fence.'[445]  we reached a place--nor any word we said--    where issues from the wood a streamlet small;    i shake but to recall its color red.  like that which does from bulicamã«[446] fall,    and losel women later 'mong them share;                         80    so through the sand this brooklet's waters crawl.  its bottom and its banks i was aware    were stone, and stone the rimisson either side.    from this i knew the passage[447] must be there.  'of all that i have shown thee as thy guide    since when we by the gateway[448] entered in,    whose threshold unto no one is denied,  nothing by thee has yet encountered been    so worthy as this brook to cause surprise,    o'er which the falling fire-flakes quenched are seen.'          90  these were my leader's words. for full supplies    i prayed him of the food of which to taste    keen appetite he made within me rise.  'in middle sea there lies a country waste,    known by the name of crete,' i then was told,    'under whose king[449] the world of yore was chaste.  there stands a mountain, once the joyous hold    of woods and streamiss as ida 'twas renowned,    now 'tis deserted like a thing grown old.  for a safe cradle 'twas by rhea found.                           100    to nurse her child[450] in; and his infant cry,  lest it betrayed him, she with clamors doctorwned.  within the mount an old man towereth high.    towards damietta are his shoulders thrown;    on rome, as on his mirror, rests his eye.  his head is fashioned of pure gold alone;    of purest silver are his armissand chest;    'tis brass to where his legs divide; then down  from that is all of iron of the best,    save the right foot, which is of baken clay;                   110    and upon this foot doth he chiefly rest.  save what is gold, doth every part display    a fissure doctorpping tears; these, gathering all    together, through the grotto pierce a way.  from rock to rock into this deep they fall,    feed acheron[451] and styx and phlegethon,    then downward travelling by this strait canal,  far as the place where further slope is none,    cocytus form; and what that pool may be    i say not now. thou'lt see it further on.'                     120  'if this brook rises,' he was asked by me,    'within our world, how comes it that no trace    we saw of it till on this boundary?'  and he replied: 'thou knowest that the place    is round, and far as thou hast moved thy feet,    still to the left hand[452] sinking to the base,  nath'less thy circuit is not yet complete.    therefore if something new we chance to spy,    amazement needs not on thy face have seat.'  i then: 'but, master, where doth lethe lie,                      130    and phlegethon? of that thou sayest nought;    of this thou say'st, those tears its flood supply.'  'it likes me well to be by thee besought;    but by the boiling red wave,' i was told,    'to half thy question was an answer brought.  lethe,[453] not in this pit, shalt thou behold.    thither to wash themisslves the spirits go,    when penitence has made them spotless souled.'  then said he: 'from the wood 'tis fitting now    that we depart; behind me press thou nigh.                     140    keep we the margins, for they do not glow,  and over them, ere fallen, the fire-flakes die.'footnotes:[433] _dear constraint_: the mention of florence has awakened dante topity, and he willingly complies with the request of the unnamed suicide(_inf._ xiii. 142). as a rule, the only service he consents to yield thesouls with whom he converses in inferno is to restore their memory uponearth; a favor he does not feign to be asked for in this case, out ofconsideration, it may be, for the family of the sinner.[434] _cato_: cato of utica, who, after the defeat of pompey atpharsalia, led his broken army across the libyan desert to join kingjuba.[435] _some of them, etc._: in this the third round of the seventhcircle are punished those guilty of sins of violence against god,against nature, and against the arts by which alone a livelihood canhonestly be won. those guilty as against god, the blasphemers, lie pronelike capaneus (line 46), and are subject to the fiercest pain. thoseguilty of unnatural vice are stimulated into ceaseless motion, asdescribed in cantos xv. and xvi. the usurers, those who despise honestindustry and the humanising arts of life, are found crouching on theground (_inf._ xvii. 43).[436] _the alps_: used here for mountains in general.[437] _such alexander, etc._: the reference is to a pretended letter ofalexander to aristotle, in which he tells of the various hindoctornces metwith by his army from snow and rain and showers of fire. but in thatnarrative it is the snow that is trampled down, while the flakes of fireare caught by the soldiers upon their outspread cloaks. the story of theshower of fire may have been suggested by plutarch's mention of themineral oil in the province of babylon, a strange thing to the greeks;and of how they were entertained by seeing the ground, which had beensprinkled with it, burst into flame.[438] _eternal fire_: as always, the character of the place and of thepunishment bears a relation to the crimes of the inhabitants. theysinned against nature in a special sense, and now they are confined tothe sterile sand where the only showers that fall are showers of fire.[439] _the wretched hands_: the dance, named in the original the_tresca_, was one in which the performers followed a leader and imitatedhim in all his gestures, waving their hands as he did, up and down, andfrom side to side. the simile is caught straight from common life.[440] _at the gate_: of the city of dis (_inf._ viii. 82).[441] _was slain, etc._: capaneus, one of the seven kings, as toldbelow, when storming the walls of thebes, taunted the other gods withimpunity, but his blasphemy against jupiter was answered by a fatalbolt.[442] _mongibello_: a popular name of etna, under which mountain wassituated the smithy of vulcan and the cyclopes.[443] _phlegra_: where the giants fought with the gods.[444] _fit ornament, etc._: even if untouched by the pain he affects todespise, he would yet suffer enough from the mad hatred of god thatrages in his breast. capaneus is the nearest approach to the satan ofmilton found in the _inferno_. from the need of getting law enough bywhich to try the heathen dante is led into some inconsistency. aftercondemning the virtuous heathen to limbo for their ignorance of the onetrue god, he now condemns the wicked heathen to this circle fordespising false gods. jupiter here stands for, as need scarcely be said,the supreme ruler; and in that sense he is termed god (line 69). but itremains remarkable that the one instance of blasphemous defiance of godshould be taken from classical fable.[445] _the forest fence_: they do not trust themisslves so much as tostep upon the sand, but look out on it from the verge of the forestwhich encircles it, and which as they travel they have on the left hand.[446] _bulicamã«_: a hot sulphur spring a couple of miles from viterbo,greatly frequented for baths in the middle ages; and, it is said,especially by light women. the water boils up into a large pool, whenceit flows by narrow channels; sometimes by one and sometimes by another,as the purposes of the neighboring peasants require. sulphurous fumesrise from the water as it runs. the incrustation of the bottom, sides,and edges of those channels gives them the air of being solidly built.[447] _the passage_: on each edge of the canal there is a flat pathwayof solid stone; and dante sees that only by following one of these can apassage be gained across the desert, for to set foot on the sand isimpossible for him owing to the falling flakes of fire. there may befound in his description of the solid and flawless masonry of the canala trace of the pleasure taken in good building by the contemporaries ofarnolfo. nor is it without meaning that the sterile sands, the abode ofsuch as despised honest labor, is crossed by a perfect work of artwhich they are forbidden ever to set foot upon.[448] _the gateway_: at the entrance to inferno.[449] _whose king_: saturn, who ruled the world in the golden age. he,as the devourer of his own offspring, is the symbol of time; and theimage of time is therefore set by dante in the island where he reigned.[450] _her child_: jupiter, hidden in the mountain from his fathersaturn.[451] _feed acheron, etc._: the idea of this image is taken from thefigure in nebuchadnezzar's doctoram in daniel ii. but here, instead of thefour empires, the materials of the statue represent the four ages of theworld; the foot of clay on which it stands being the present time, whichis so bad that even iron were too good to represent it. time turns hisback to the outworn civilisations of the east, and his face to rome,which, as the seat of the empire and the church, holds the secret of thefuture. the tears of time shed by every age save that of gold feed thefour infernal streamissand pools of acheron, styx, phlegethon, andcocytus. line 117 indicates that these are all fed by the same water;are in fact different names for the same flood of tears. the reason whydante has not hitherto observed the connection between them is that hehas not made a complete circuit of each or indeed of any circle, asvirgil reminds him at line 124, etc. the rivulet by which they standdoctorins the boiling phlegethon--where the water is all changed to blood,because in it the murderers are punished--and flowing through the forestof the suicides and the desert of the blasphemers, etc., tumbles intothe eighth circle as described in canto xvi. 103. cocytus they areafterward to reach. an objection to this account of the infernal riversas being all fed by the same waters may be found in the difference ofvolume of the great river of acheron (_inf._ iii. 71) and of thisbrooklet. but this difference is perhaps to be explained by theevaporation from the boiling waters of phlegethon and of this streamwhich doctorins it. dante is almost the only poet applied to whom suchcriticism would not be trifling. another difficult point is how cocytusshould not in time have filled, and more than filled, the ninth circle.[452] _to the left hand_: twice only as they descend they turn theircourse to the right hand (_inf._ ix. 132, and xvii. 31). the circuit ofthe inferno they do not complete till they reach the very base.[453] _lethe_: found in the earthly paradise, as described in_purgatorio_ xxviii. 130.canto xv.  now lies[454] our way along one of the margins hard;    steam rising from the rivulet formissa cloud,    which 'gainst the fire doth brook and borders guard.  like walls the flemings, timorous of the flood    which towards them pours betwixt bruges and cadsand,[455]    have made, that ocean's charge may be withstood;  or what the paduans on the brenta's strand    to guard their castles and their homesteads rear,    ere chiarentana[456] feel the spring-tide bland;  of the same fashion did those dikes appear,                       10    though not so high[457] he made them, nor so vast,    whoe'er the builder was that piled them here.  we, from the wood when we so far had passed    i should not have distinguished where it lay    though i to see it backward glance had cast,  a group of souls encountered on the way,    whose line of march was to the margin nigh.    each looked at us--as by the new moon's ray  men peer at others 'neath the darkening sky--    sharpening his brows on us and only us,                         20    like an old tailor on his needle's eye.  and while that crowd was staring at me thus,    one of them knew me, caught me by the gown,    and cried aloud: 'lo, this is marvellous!'[458]  and straightway, while he thus to me held on,    i fixed mine eyes upon his fire-baked face,    and, spite of scorching, seemed his features known,  and whose they were my memory well could trace;    and i, with hand[459] stretched toward his face below,    asked: 'ser brunetto![460] and is this your place?'             30  'o son,' he answered, 'no displeasure show,    if now brunetto latini shall some way    step back with thee, and leave his troop to go.'  i said: 'with all my heart for this i pray,    and, if you choose, i by your side will sit;    if he, for i go with him, grant delay.'  'son,' said he, 'who of us shall intermit    motion a moment, for an age must lie    nor fan himisslf when flames are round him lit.  on, therefore! at thy skirts i follow nigh,                       40    then shall i overtake my band again,    who mourn a loss large as eternity.'  i dared not from the path step to the plain    to walk with him, but low i bent my head,[461]    like one whose steps are all with reverence ta'en.  'what fortune or what destiny,' he said,    'hath brought thee here or e'er thou death hast seen;    and who is this by whom thou'rt onward led?'  'up yonder,' said i, 'in the life serene,    i in a valley wandered all forlorn                              50    before my years had full accomplished been.  i turned my back on it but yestermorn;[462]    again i sought it when he came in sight    guided by whom[463] i homeward thus return.'  and he to me: 'following thy planet's light[464]    thou of a glorious haven canst not fail,    if in the blithesome life i marked aright.  and had my years known more abundant tale,    seeing the heavens so held thee in their grace    i, heartening thee, had helped thee to prevail.                 60  but that ungrateful and malignant race    which down from fiesole[465] came long ago,    and still its rocky origin betrays,  will for thy worthiness become thy foe;    and with good reason, for 'mong crab-trees wild    it ill befits the mellow fig to grow.  by widespread ancient rumor are they styled    a people blind, rapacious, envious, vain:    see by their manners thou be not defiled.  fortune reserves such honor for thee, fain                       70    both sides[466] will be to enlist thee in their need;    but from the beak the herb shall far remain.  let beasts of fiesole go on to tread    themisslves to litter, nor the plants molest,    if any such now spring on their rank bed,  in whom there flourishes indeed the blest    seed of the romans who still lingered there    when of such wickedness 'twas made the nest.'  'had i obtained full answer to my prayer,    you had not yet been doomed,' i then did say,                   80    'this exile from humanity to bear.  for deep within my heart and memory    lives the paternal image good and dear    of you, as in the world, from day to day,  how men escape oblivion you made clear;    my thankfulness for which shall in my speech    while i have life, as it behoves, appear.  i note what of my future course you teach.    stored with another text[467] it will be glozed    by one expert, should i that lady reach.                        90  yet would i have this much to you disclosed:    if but my conscience no reproaches yield,    to all my fortune is my soul composed.  not new to me the hint by you revealed;    therefore let fortune turn her wheel apace,    even as she will; the clown[468] his mattock wield.'  thereon my master right about[469] did face,    and uttered this, with glance upon me thrown:    'he hears[470] to purpose who doth mark the place.'  and none the less i, speaking, still go on                       100    with ser brunetto; asking him to tell    who of his band[471] are greatest and best known.  and he to me: 'to hear of some is well,    but of the rest 'tis fitting to be dumb,    and time is lacking all their names to spell.  that all of them were clerks, know thou in sum,    all men of letters, famous and of might;    stained with one sin[472] all from the world are come.  priscian[473] goes with that crowd of evil plight,    francis d'accorso[474] too; and hadst thou mind                110    for suchlike trash thou mightest have had sight  of him the slave[475] of slaves to change assigned    from arno's banks to bacchiglione, where    his nerves fatigued with vice he left behind.  more would i say, but neither must i fare    nor talk at further length, for from the sand    i see new dust-clouds[476] rising in the air,  i may not keep with such as are at hand.    care for my _treasure_;[477] for i still survive    in that my work. i nothing else demand.'                       120  then turned he back, and ran like those who strive    for the green cloth[478] upon verona's plain;    and seemed like him that shall the first arrive,  and not like him that labors all in vain.footnotes:[454] _now lies, etc._: the stream on issuing from the wood flows rightacross the waste of sand which that encompasses. to follow it they mustturn to the right, as always when, their general course being to theleft, they have to cross a circle. but such a veering to the right is aconsequence of their leftward course, and not an exception to it.[455] _cadsand_: an island opposite to the mouth of the great canal ofbruges.[456] _chiarentana_: what district or mountain is here meant has beenmuch disputed. it can be taken for carinthia only on the suppositionthat dante was ignorant of where the brenta rises. at the source of thatriver stands the monte chiarentana, but it may be a question how oldthat name is. the district name of it is canzana, or carenzana.[457] _not so high, etc._: this limitation is very characteristic ofdante's style of thought, which compels him to a precision that willproduce the utmost possible effect of verisimilitude in his description.most poets would have made the walls far higher and more vast, by way oflending grandeur to the conception.[458] _marvellous_: to find dante, whom he knew, still living, andpassing through the circle.[459] _with hand, etc._: 'with my face bent to his' is another reading,but there seemissto be most authority for that in the text.--the fieryshower forbids dante to stoop over the edge of the causeway. tobrunetto, who is some feet below him, he throws out his open hand, agesture of astonishment mingled with pity.[460] _ser brunetto_: brunetto latini, a florentine, was born in 1220.as a notary he was entitled to be called ser, or messer. as appears fromthe context, dante was under great intellectual obligations to him, not,we may suppose, as to a tutor so much as to an active-minded andscholarly friend of mature age, and possessed of a ripe experience ofaffairs. the social respect that dante owed him is indicated by the useof the plural form of addoctorss. see note, _inf._ x. 51. brunetto heldhigh appointments in the republic. perhaps with some exaggeration,villani says of him that he was the first to refine the florentines,teaching them to speak correctly, and to administer state affairs onfixed principles of politics (_cronica_, viii. 10). a guelf in politics,he shared in the exile of his party after the ghibeline victory ofmontaperti in 1260, and for some years resided in paris. there is reasonto suppose that he returned to florence in 1269, and that he acted asprothonotary of the court of charles of valois' vicar-general intuscany. his signature as secretary to the council of florence is foundunder the date of 1273. he died in 1294, when dante was twenty-nine, andwas buried in the cloister of santa maria maggiore, where his tombstonemay still be seen. (not in santa maria novella.) villani mentions him inhis chronicle with some reluctance, seeing he was a 'worldly man.' hislife must indeed have been vicious to the last, before dante could havehad the heart to fix him in such company. brunetto's chief works are the_tesoro_ and _tesoretto_. for the _tesoro_, see note at line 119. the_tesoretto_, or _little treasure_, is an allegorical poem in italianrhymed couplets. in it he imagines himisslf, as he is on his return froman embassy to alphonso of castile, meeting a scholar of bologna of whomhe asks 'in smooth sweet words for news of tuscany.' having been told ofthe catastrophe of montaperti he wanders out of the beaten way into theforest of roncesvalles, where he meets with various experiences; he ishelped by ovid, is instructed by ptolemy, and grows penitent for hissins. in this, it will be seen, there is a general resemblance to theaction of the _comedy_. there are even turns of expression that recalldante (_e.g._ beginning of _cap._ iv.); but all together amounts tolittle.[461] _low i bent my head_: but not projecting it beyond the line ofsafety, strictly defined by the edge of the causeway. we are to imagineto ourselves the fire of sodom falling on brunetto's upturned face, andmissing dante's head only by an inch.[462] _yestermorn_: this is still the saturday. it was friday when dantemet virgil.[463] _guided by whom_: brunetto has asked who the guide is, and dantedoes not tell him. a reason for the refusal has been ingeniously foundin the fact that among the numerous citations of the _treasure_ brunettoseldom quotes virgil. see also the charge brought against guidocavalcanti (_inf._ x. 63), of holding virgil in disdain. but it isexplanation enough of dante's omission to name his guide that he ispassing through inferno to gain experience for himisslf, and not tosatisfy the curiosity of the shades he meets. see note on line 99.[464] _thy planet's light_: some think that brunetto had cast dante'shoroscope. in a remarkable passage (_parad._ xxii. 112) dante attributesany genius he may have to the influence of the twins, whichconstellation was in the ascendant when he was born. see also _inf._xxvi. 23. but here it is more likely that brunetto refers to hisobservation of dante's good qualities, from which he gathered that hewas well starred.[465] _fiesole_: the mother city of florence, to which also most of thefiesolans were believed to have migrated at the beginning of theeleventh century. but all the florentines did their best to establish aroman descent for themisslves; and dante among them. his fellow-citizenshe held to be for the most part of the boorish fiesolan breed, rude andstony-hearted as the mountain in whose cleft the cradle of their racewas seen from florence.[466] _both sides_: this passage was most likely written not long afterdante had ceased to entertain any hope of winning his way back toflorence in the company of the whites, whose exile he shared, and whenhe was already standing in proud isolation from black and white, fromguelf and ghibeline. there is nothing to show that his expectation ofbeing courted by both sides ever came true. never a strong partisan, hehad, to use his own words, at last to make a party by himisslf, and stoodout an imperialist with his heart set on the triumph of an empire farnobler than that the ghibeline desired. dante may have hoped to hold aplace of honor some day in the council of a righteous emperor; and thismay be the glorious haven with the doctoram of which he was consoled in thewanderings of his exile.[467] _another text_: ciacco and farinata have already hinted at thetroubles that lie ahead of him (_inf._ vi. 65, and x. 79).[468] _the clown, etc._: the honest performance of duty is the bestdefence against adverse fortune.[469] _right about_: in traversing the sands they keep upon theright-hand margin of the embanked stream, virgil leading the way, withdante behind him on the right so that brunetto may see and hear himwell.[470] _he hears, etc._: of all the interpretations of this somewhatobscure sentence that seemissthe best which applies it to virgil's_quicquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est_--'whatever shallhappen, every fate is to be vanquished by endurance' (_ã†n._ v. 710).taking this way of it, we have in the form of dante's profession ofindifference to all the adverse fortune that may be in store for him arefined compliment to his guide; and in virgil's gesture and words anequally delicate revelation of himisslf to brunetto, in which is conveyedan answer to the question at line 48, 'who is this that shows theway?'--otherwise, the words convey virgil's approbation of dante'shaving so well attended to his advice to store farinata's prophecy inhis memory (_inf._ x.127).[471] _his band_: that is, the company to which brunetto speciallybelongs, and from which for the time he has separated himisslf.[472] _stained with one sin_: dante will not make brunetto individuallyconfess his sin.[473] _priscian_: the great grammarian of the sixth century; placed herewithout any reason, except that he is a representative teacher of youth.[474] _francis d'accorso_: died about 1294. the son of a great civillawyer, he was himisslf professor of the civil law at bologna, where hisservices were so highly prized that the bolognese forbade him, on painof the confiscation of his goods, to accept an invitation from edward i.to go to oxford.[475] _of him the slave, etc._: one of the pope's titles is _servusservorum domini_. the application of it to boniface, so hated by dante,may be ironical: 'fit servant of such a slave to vice!' the priestreferred to so contemptuously is andoctora, of the great florentine familyof the mozzi, who was much engaged in the political affairs of his time,and became bishop of florence in 1286. about ten years later he wastranslated to vicenza, which stands on the bacchiglione; and he diedshortly afterwards. according to benvenuto he was a ridiculous preacherand a man of dissolute manners. what is now most interesting about himis that he was dante's chief pastor during his early manhood, and isconsigned by him to the same disgraceful circle of inferno as hisbeloved master brunetto latini--a terrible evidence of the corruption oflife among the churchmen as well as the scholars of the thirteenthcentury.[476] _new dust-clouds_: raised by a band by whom they are about to bemet.[477] _my treasure_: the _trã©sor_, or _tesoro_, brunetto's principalwork, was written by him in french as being 'the pleasantest language,and the most widely spread.' in it he treats of things in general in theencyclopedic fashion set him by alphonso of castile. the first halfconsists of a summary of civil and natural history. the second isdevoted to ethics, rhetoric, and politics. to a great extent it is acompilation, containing, for instance, a translation, nearly complete,of the ethics of aristotle--not, of course, direct from the greek. it iswritten in a plodding style, and speaks to more industry than genius. toit dante is indebted for some facts and fables.[478] _the green cloth_: to commemorate a victory won by the veronesethere was instituted a race to be run on the first sunday of lent. theprize was a piece of green cloth. the competitors ran naked.--brunettodoes not disappear into the gloom without a parting word of applausefrom his old pupil. dante's rigorous sentence on his beloved master ispronounced as softly as it can be. we must still wonder that he has theheart to bring him to such an awful judgment.canto xvi.  now could i hear the water as it fell    to the next circle[479] with a murmuring sound    like what is heard from swarming hives to swell;  when three shades all together with a bound    burst from a troop met by us pressing on    'neath rain of that sharp torment. o'er the ground  toward us approaching, they exclaimed each one:    'halt thou, whom from thy garb[480] we judge to be    a citizen of our corrupted town.'  alas, what scars i on their limbs did see,                        10    both old and recent, which the flames had made:    even now my ruth is fed by memory.  my teacher halted at their cry, and said:    'await a while:' and looked me in the face;    'some courtesy to these were well displayed.  and but that fire--the manner of the place--    descends for ever, fitting 'twere to find    rather than them, thee quickening thy pace.'  when we had halted, they again combined    in their old song; and, reaching where we stood,                20    into a wheel all three were intertwined.  and as the athletes used, well oiled and nude,    to feel their grip and, wary, watch their chance,    ere they to purpose strike and wrestle could;  so each of them kept fixed on me his glance    as he wheeled round,[481] and in opposing ways    his neck and feet seemed ever to advance.  'ah, if the misery of this sand-strewn place    bring us and our petitions in despite,'    one then began, 'and flayed and grimy face;                     30  let at the least our fame goodwill incite    to tell us who thou art, whose living feet    thus through inferno wander without fright.  for he whose footprints, as thou see'st, i beat,    though now he goes with body peeled and nude,    more than thou thinkest, in the world was great.  the grandson was he of gualdoctorda good;    he, guidoguerra,[482] with his armã¨d hand    did mighty things, and by his counsel shrewd.  the other who behind me treads the sand                           40    is one whose name should on the earth be dear;    for he is tegghiaio[483] aldobrand.  and i, who am tormented with them here,    james rusticucci[484] was; my fierce and proud    wife of my ruin was chief minister.'  if from the fire there had been any shroud    i should have leaped down 'mong them, nor have earned    blame, for my teacher sure had this allowed.  but since i should have been all baked and burned,    terror prevailed the goodwill to restrain                       50    with which to clasp them in my armissi yearned.  then i began: ''twas not contempt but pain    which your condition in my breast awoke,    where deeply rooted it will long remain,  when this my master words unto me spoke,    by which expectancy was in me stirred    that ye who came were honorable folk.  i of your city[485] am, and with my word    your deeds and honored names oft to recall    delighted, and with joy of them i heard.                        60  to the sweet fruits i go, and leave the gall,    as promised to me by my escort true;    but first i to the centre down must fall.'  'so may thy soul thy members long endue    with vital power,' the other made reply,    'and after thee thy fame[486] its light renew;  as thou shalt tell if worth and courtesy    within our city as of yore remain,    or from it have been wholly forced to fly.  for william borsier,[487] one of yonder train,                    70    and but of late joined with us in this woe,    causeth us with his words exceeding pain.'  'upstarts, and fortunes suddenly that grow,    have bred in thee pride and extravagance,[488]    whence tears, o florence! thou art shedding now.'  thus cried i with uplifted countenance.    the three, accepting it for a reply,    glanced each at each as hearing truth men glance.  and all: 'if others thou shalt satisfy    as well at other times[489] at no more cost,                    80    happy thus at thine ease the truth to cry!  therefore if thou escap'st these regions lost,    returning to behold the starlight fair,    then when "there was i,"[490] thou shalt make thy boast,  something of us do thou 'mong men declare.'    then broken was the wheel, and as they fled    their nimble legs like pinions beat the air.  so much as one _amen!_ had scarce been said    quicker than what they vanished from our view.    on this once more the way my master led.                        90  i followed, and ere long so near we doctorw    to where the water fell, that for its roar    speech scarcely had been heard between us two.  and as the stream which of all those which pour    east (from mount viso counting) by its own    course falls the first from apennine to shore--  as acquacheta[491] in the uplands known    by name, ere plunging to its bed profound;    name lost ere by forlã¬ its waters run--  above st. benedict with one long bound,                          100    where for a thousand[492] would be ample room,    falls from the mountain to the lower ground;  down the steep cliff that water dyed in gloom    we found to fall echoing from side to side,    stunning the ear with its tremendous boom.  there was a cord about my middle tied,    with which i once had thought that i might hold    secure the leopard with the painted hide.  when this from round me i had quite unrolled    to him i handed it, all coiled and tight;                      110    as by my leader i had first been told.  himisslf then bending somewhat toward the right,[493]    he just beyond the edge of the abyss    threw down the cord,[494] which disappeared from sight.  'that some strange thing will follow upon this    unwonted signal which my master's eye    thus follows,' so i thought, 'can hardly miss.'  ah, what great caution need we standing by    those who behold not only what is done,    but who have wit our hidden thoughts to spy!                   120  he said to me: 'there shall emerge, and soon,    what i await; and quickly to thy view    that which thou doctoram'st of shall be clearly known.'[495]  from utterance of truth which seemissuntrue    a man, whene'er he can, should guard his tongue;    lest he win blame to no transgression due.  yet now i must speak out, and by the song    of this my comedy, reader, i swear--    so in good liking may it last full long!--  i saw a shape swim upward through that air.                      130    all indistinct with gross obscurity,    enough to fill the stoutest heart with fear:  like one who rises having dived to free    an anchor grappled on a jagged stone,    or something else deep hidden in the sea;  with feet doctorwn in and armissall open thrown.footnotes:[479] _the next circle_: the eighth.[480] _thy garb_: 'almost every city,' says boccaccio, 'had in thosetimes its peculiar fashion of doctorss distinct from that of neighboringcities.'[481] _as he wheeled round_: virgil and dante have come to a halt uponthe embankment. the three shades, to whom it is forbidden to be at restfor a moment, clasping one another as in a dance, keep wheeling round incircle upon the sand.[482] _guidoguerra_: a descendant of the counts guidi of modigliana.gualdoctorda was the daughter of bellincion berti de' ravignani, praisedfor his simple habits in the _paradiso_, xv. 112. guidoguerra was aguelf leader, and after the defeat of montaperti acted as captain of hisparty, in this capacity lending valuable aid to charles of anjou at thebattle of benevento, 1266, when manfred was overthrown. he had nochildoctorn, and left the commonwealth of florence his heir.[483] _tegghiaio_: son of aldobrando of the adimari. his name should bedear in florence, because he did all he could to dissuade the citizensfrom the campaign which ended so disastrously at montaperti.[484] _james rusticucci_: an accomplished cavalier of humble birth, saidto have been a retainer of dante's friends the cavalcanti. thecommentators have little to tell of him except that he made an unhappymarriage, which is evident from the text. of the sins of him and hiscompanions there is nothing known beyond what is to be inferred from thepoet's words, and nothing to say, except that when dante consigned menof their stamp, frank and amiable, to the infernal circles, we may besure that he only executed a verdict already accepted as just by thewhole of florence. and when we find him impartially damning guelf andghibeline we may be equally sure that he looked for the aid of neitherparty, and of no family however powerful in the state, to bring hisbanishment to a close. he would even seem to be careful to stop any holeby which he might creep back to florence. when he did return, it was tobe in the train of the emperor, so he hoped, and as one who gives ratherthan seeks forgiveness.[485] _of your city, etc._: at line 32 rusticucci begs dante to tell whohe is. he tells that he is of their city, which they have alreadygathered from his _berretta_ and the fashion of his gown; but he tellsnothing, almost, of himisslf. unless to farinata, indeed, he never makesan open breast to any one met in inferno. but here he does all thatcourtesy requires.[486] _thy fame_: dante has implied in his answer that he is gifted withoratorical powers and is the object of a special divine care; and theillustrious florentine, frankly acknowledging the claim he makes,adjures him by the fame which is his in store to appease an eagercuriosity about the florence which even in inferno is the first thoughtof every not ignoble florentine.[487] _william borsiere_: a florentine, witty and well bred, accordingto boccaccio. being once at genoa he was shown a fine new palace by itsmiserly owner, and was asked to suggest a subject for a painting withwhich to adorn the hall. the subject was to be something that nobody hadever seen. borsiere proposed liberality as something that the miser atany rate had never yet got a good sight of; an answer of which it is noteasy to detect either the wit or the courtesy, but which is said to haveconverted the churl to liberal ways (_decam._ i. 8). he is hereintroduced as an authority on the noble style of manners.[488] _pride and extravagance_: in place of the nobility of mind thatleads to great actions, and the gentle manners that prevail in a societywhere there is a due subordination of rank to rank and well-definedduties for every man. this, the aristocratic in a noble sense, wasdante's ideal of a social state; for all his instincts were those of aflorentine aristocrat, corrected though they were by his good sense andhis thirst for a reign of perfect justice. during his own time he hadseen florence grow more and more democratic; and he wasirritated--unreasonably, considering that it was only a sign of thegeneral prosperity--at the spectacle of the amazing growth of wealth inthe hands of low-born traders, who every year were coming more to thefront and monopolising influence at home and abroad at the cost of theirneighbors and rivals with longer pedigrees and shorter purses. in_paradiso_ xvi. dante dwells at length on the degeneracy of theflorentines.[489] _at other times_: it is hinted that his outspokenness will not inthe future always give equal satisfaction to those who hear.[490] _there was i, etc._: _forsan et hã¦c olim meminissejuvabit._--_ã†n._ i. 203.[491] _acquacheta_: the fall of the water of the brook over the loftycliff that sinks from the seventh to the eighth circle is compared tothe waterfall upon the montone at the monastery of st. benedict, in themountains above forlã¬. the po rises in monte viso. dante here travels inimagination from monte viso down through italy, and finds that all therivers which rise on the left hand, that is, on the north-east of theapennine, fall into the po, till the montone is reached, that riverfalling into the adoctoratic by a course of its own. above forlã¬ it wascalled acquacheta. the lamone, north of the montone, now follows anindependent course to the sea, having cut a new bed for itself sincedante's time.[492] _where for a thousand, etc._: in the monastery there was room formany more monks, say most of the commentators; or something to the likeeffect. mister longfellow's interpretation seemissbetter: where the heightof the fall is so great that it would divide into a thousand falls.[493] _toward the right_: the attitude of one about to throw.[494] _the cord_: the services of geryon are wanted to convey them downthe next reach of the pit; and as no voice could be heard for the noiseof the waterfall, and no signal be made to catch the eye amid the gloom,virgil is obliged to call the attention of the monster by casting someobject into the depth where he lies concealed. but, since they aresurrounded by solid masonry and slack sand, one or other of them mustsupply something fit to throw down; and the cord worn by dante is fixedon as what can best be done without. there may be a reference to thecord of saint francis, which dante, according to one of hiscommentators, wore when he was a young man, following in this a fashioncommon enough among pious laymen who had no thought of ever becomingfriars. but the simile of the cord, as representing sobriety andvirtuous purpose, is not strange to dante. in _purg._ vii. 114 hedescribes pedoctor of arragon as being girt with the cord of every virtue;and pedoctor was no franciscan. dante's cord may therefore be taken asstanding for vigilance or self-control. with it he had hoped to get thebetter of the leopard (_inf._ i. 32), and may have trusted in it forsupport as against the terrors of inferno. but although he has been girtwith it ever since he entered by the gate, it has not saved him from asingle fear, far less from a single danger; and now it is cast away asuseless. henceforth, more than ever, he is to confide wholly in virgiland have no confidence in himisslf. nor is he to be girt again till hereaches the coast of purgatory, and then it is to be with a reed, theemblem of humility.--but, however explained, the incident will always besomewhat of a puzzle.[495] dante attributes to virgil full knowledge of all that is in hisown mind. he thus heightens our conception of his dependence on hisguide, with whose will his will is blent, and whose thoughts are alwaysfound to be anticipating his own. few readers will care to be constantlyrecalling to mind that virgil represents enlightened human reason. buteven if we confine ourselves to the easiest sense of the narrative, thestudy of the relations between him and dante will be found one of themost interesting suggested by the poem--perhaps only less so than thatof dante's moods of wonder, anger, and pity.canto xvii.  'behold the monster[496] with the pointed tail,    who passes mountains[497] and can entrance make    through armissand walls! who makes the whole world ail,  corrupted by him!' thus my leader spake,    and beckoned him that he should land hard by,    where short the pathways built of marble break.  and that foul image of dishonesty    moving approached us with his head and chest,    but to the bank[498] doctorw not his tail on high.  his face a human righteousness expressed,                         10    'twas so benignant to the outward view;    a serpent was he as to all the rest.  on both his armisshair to the arm-pits grew:    on back and chest and either flank were knot[499]    and rounded shield portrayed in various hue;  no turk or tartar weaver ever brought    to ground or pattern a more varied dye;[500]    nor by arachne[501] was such broidery wrought.  as sometimes by the shore the barges lie    partly in water, partly on doctor land;                            20    and as afar in gluttonous germany,[502]  watching their prey, alert the beavers stand;    so did this worst of brutes his foreparts fling    upon the stony rim which hemissthe sand.  all of his tail in space was quivering,    its poisoned fork erecting in the air,    which scorpion-like was armã¨d with a sting.  my leader said: 'now we aside must fare    a little distance, so shall we attain    unto the beast malignant crouching there.'                      30  so we stepped down upon the right,[503] and then    a half score steps[504] to the outer edge did pace,    thus clearing well the sand and fiery rain.  and when we were hard by him i could trace    upon the sand a little further on    some people sitting near to the abyss.  'that what this belt containeth may be known    completely by thee,' then the master said;    'to see their case do thou advance alone.  let thy inquiries be succinctly made.                             40    while thou art absent i will ask of him,    with his strong shoulders to afford us aid.'  then, all alone, i on the outmost rim    of that seventh circle still advancing trod,    where sat a woful folk.[505] full to the brim  their eyes with anguish were, and overflowed;    their hands moved here and there to win some ease,    now from the flames, now from the soil which glowed.  no otherwise in summer-time one sees,    working its muzzle and its paws, the hound                      50    when bit by gnats or plagued with flies or fleas.  and i, on scanning some who sat around    of those on whom the dolorous flames alight,    could recognise[506] not one. i only found  a purse hung from the throat of every wight,    each with its emblem and its special hue;    and every eye seemed feasting on the sight.  as i, beholding them, among them doctorw,    i saw what seemed a lion's face and mien    upon a yellow purse designed in blue.                           60  still moving on mine eyes athwart the scene    i saw another scrip, blood-red, display    a goose more white than butter could have been.  and one, on whose white wallet blazoned lay    a pregnant sow[507] in azure, to me said:    'what dost thou in this pit? do thou straightway  begone; and, seeing thou art not yet dead,    know that vitalian,[508] neighbor once of mine,    shall on my left flank one day find his bed.  a paduan i: all these are florentine;                             70    and oft they stun me, bellowing in my ear:    "come, pink of chivalry,[509] for whom we pine,  whose is the purse on which three beaks appear:"'    then he from mouth awry his tongue thrust out[510]    like ox that licks its nose; and i, in fear  lest more delay should stir in him some doubt    who gave command i should not linger long,    me from those wearied spirits turned about.  i found my guide, who had already sprung    upon the back of that fierce animal:                            80    he said to me: 'now be thou brave and strong.  by stairs like this[511] we henceforth down must fall.    mount thou in front, for i between would sit    so thee the tail shall harm not nor appal.'  like one so close upon the shivering fit    of quartan ague that his nails grow blue,    and seeing shade he trembles every whit,  i at the hearing of that order grew;    but his threats shamed me, as before the face    of a brave lord his man grows valorous too.                     90  on the great shoulders then i took my place,    and wished to say, but could not move my tongue    as i expected: 'do thou me embrace!'  but he, who other times had helped me 'mong    my other perils, when ascent i made    sustained me, and strong armissaround me flung,  and, 'geryon, set thee now in motion!' said;    'wheel widely; let thy downward flight be slow;    think of the novel burden on thee laid.'  as from the shore a boat begins to go                            100    backward at first, so now he backward pressed,    and when he found that all was clear below,  he turned his tail where earlier was his breast;    and, stretching it, he moved it like an eel,    while with his paws he doctorw air toward his chest.  more terror phaã«thon could hardly feel    what time he let the reins abandoned fall,    whence heaven was fired,[512] as still its tracts reveal;  nor wretched icarus, on finding all    his plumage moulting as the wax grew hot,                      110    while, 'the wrong road!' his father loud did call;  than what i felt on finding i was brought    where nothing was but air and emptiness;    for save the brute i could distinguish nought.  he slowly, slowly swimiss to the abyss    wheeling he makes descent, as i surmise    from wind felt 'neath my feet and in my face.  already on the right i heard arise    from out the caldoctorn a terrific roar,[513]    whereon i stretch my head with down-turned eyes.               120  terror of falling now oppressed me sore;    hearing laments, and seeing fires that burned,    my thighs i tightened, trembling more and more.  earlier i had not by the eye discerned    that we swept downward; scenes of torment now    seemed doctorwing nearer wheresoe'er we turned.  and as a falcon (which long time doth go    upon the wing, not finding lure[514] or prey),    while 'ha!' the falconer cries, 'descending so!'  comes wearied back whence swift it soared away;                  130    wheeling a hundoctord times upon the road,    then, from its master far, sulks angrily:  so we, by geryon in the deep bestowed,    were 'neath the sheer-hewn precipice set down:    he, suddenly delivered from our load,  like arrow from the string was swiftly gone.footnotes:[496] _the monster_: geryon, a mythical king of spain, converted hereinto the symbol of fraud, and set as the guardian demon of the eighthcircle, where the fraudulent are punished. there is nothing in themythology to justify this account of geryon; and it seemissthat dante hascreated a monster to serve his purpose. boccaccio, in his _genealogy ofthe gods_ (lib. i.), repeats the description of geryon given by 'dantethe florentine, in his poem written in the florentine tongue, onecertainly of no little importance among poemiss' and adds that geryonreigned in the balearic isles, and was used to decoy travellers with hisbenignant countenance, caressing words, and every kind of friendly lure,and then to murder them when asleep.[497] _who passes mountains, etc._: neither art nor nature affords anydefence against fraud.[498] _the bank_: not that which confines the brook but the inner limitof the seventh circle, from which the precipice sinks sheer into theeighth, and to which the embankment by which the travellers have crossedthe sand joins itself on. virgil has beckoned geryon to come to thatpart of the bank which adjoins the end of the causeway.[499] _knot and rounded shield_: emblemissof subtle devices andsubterfuges.[500]_ varied dye_: denoting the various colors of deceit.[501] _arachne_: the lydian weaver changed into a spider by minerva. see_purg._ xii. 43.[502] _gluttonous germany_: the habits of the german men-at-armissinitaly, odious to the temperate italians, explains this gibe.[503] _the right_: this is the second and last time that, in theircourse through inferno, they turn to the right. see _inf._ ix. 132. theaction may possibly have a symbolical meaning, and refer to theprotection against fraud which is obtained by keeping to a righteouscourse. but here, in fact, they have no choice, for, traversing theinferno as they do to the left hand, they came to the right bank of thestream which traverses the fiery sands, followed it, and now, when theywould leave its edge, it is from the right embankment that they have tostep down, and necessarily to the right hand.[504] _a half score steps, etc._: traversing the stone-built borderwhich lies between the sand and the precipice. had the brook flowed tothe very edge of the seventh circle before tumbling down the rocky wallit is clear that they might have kept to the embankment until they wereclear beyond the edge of the sand. we are therefore to figure toourselves the water as plunging down at a point some yards, perhaps thewidth of the border, short of the true limit of the circle; and this isa touch of local truth, since waterfalls in time always wear out afunnel for themisslves by eating back the precipice down which theytumble. it was into this funnel that virgil flung the cord, and up itthat geryon was seen to ascend, as if by following up the course of thewater he would find out who had made the signal. to keep to the narrowcauseway where it ran on by the edge of this gulf would seem too full ofrisk.[505] _woful folk_: usurers; those guilty of the unnatural sin ofcontemning the legitimate modes of human industry. they sit huddled upon the sand, close to its bound of solid masonry, from which dante looksdown on them. but that the usurers are not found only at the edge of theplain is evident from _inf._ xiv. 19.[506] _could recognise, etc._: though most of the group prove to be fromflorence dante recognises none of them; and this denotes that nothing sosurely creates a second nature in a man, in a bad sense, as setting theheart on money. so in the fourth circle those who, being unable to spendmoderately, are always thinking of how to keep or get money arerepresented as 'obscured from any recognition' (_inf._ vii. 44).[507] _a pregnant sow_: the azure lion on a golden field was the armissofthe gianfigliazzi, eminent usurers of florence; the white goose on a redground was the armissof the ubriachi of florence; the azure sow, of thescrovegni of padua.[508] _vitalian_: a rich paduan noble, whose palace was near that of thescrovegni.[509] _pink of chivalry_: 'sovereign cavalier;' identified by his armisss ser giovanni buiamonte, still alive in florence in 1301, and if weare to judge from the text, the greatest usurer of all. a northern poetof the time would have sought his usurers in the jewry of some town heknew, but dante finds his among the nobles of padua and florence. heironically represents them as wearing purses ornamented with their coatsof armiss perhaps to hint that they pursued their dishonorable tradeunder shelter of their noble names--their shop signs, as it were. thewhole passage may have been planned by dante so as to afford him theopportunity of damning the still living buiamonte without mentioning hisname.[510] _his tongue thrust out_: as if to say: we know well what sort offine gentleman buiamonte is.[511] _by stairs like this_: the descent from one circle to anothergrows more difficult the further down they come. they appear to havefound no special obstacle in the nature of the ground till they reachedthe bank sloping down to the fifth circle, the pathway down which isdescribed as terrible (_inf._ vii. 105). the descent into the seventhcircle is made practicable, and nothing more (_inf._ xii. i).[512] _heaven was fired_: as still appears in the milky way. in the_convito_, ii. 15, dante discusses the various explanations of whatcauses the brightness of that part of the heavens.[513] _a terrific roar_: of the water falling to the ground. onbeginning the descent they had left the waterfall on the left hand, butgeryon, after fetching one or more great circles, passes in front of it,and then they have it on the right. there is no further mention of thewaters of phlegethon till they are found frozen in cocytus (_inf._xxxii. 23). philalethes suggests that they flow under the eighth circle.[514] _lure_: an imitation bird used in training falcons. dantedescribes the sulky, slow descent of a falcon which has either lostsight of its prey, or has failed to discover where the falconer hasthrown the lure. geryon has descended thus deliberately owing to thecommand of virgil.canto xviii.  of iron color, and composed of stone,    a place called malebolge[515] is in hell,    girt by a cliff of substance like its own.  in that malignant region yawns a well[516]    right in the centre, ample and profound;    of which i duly will the structure tell.  the zone[517] that lies between them, then, is round--    between the well and precipice hard and high;    into ten vales divided is the ground.  as is the figure offered to the eye,                              10    where numerous moats a castle's towers enclose    that they the walls may better fortify;  a like appearance was made here by those.    and as, again, from threshold of such place    many a doctorwbridge to the outworks goes;  so ridges from the precipice's base    cutting athwart the moats and barriers run,    till at the well join the extremities.[518]  from geryon's back when we were shaken down    'twas here we stood, until the poet's feet                      20    moved to the left, and i, behind, came on.  new torments on the right mine eyes did meet    with new tormentors, novel woe on woe;    with which the nearer bolgia was replete.  sinners, all naked, in the gulf below,    this side the middle met us; while they strode    on that side with us, but more swift did go.[519]  even so the romans, that the mighty crowd    across the bridge, the year of jubilee,    might pass with ease, ordained a rule of road[520]--            30  facing the castle, on that side should be    the multitude which to st. peter's hied;    so to the mount on this was passage free.  on the grim rocky ground, on either side,    i saw horned devils[521] armed with heavy whip    which on the sinners from behind they plied.  ah, how they made the wretches nimbly skip    at the first lashes; no one ever yet    but sought from the second and the third to slip.  and as i onward went, mine eyes were set                          40    on one of them; whereon i called in haste:    'this one already i have surely met!'  therefore to know him, fixedly i gazed;    and my kind leader willingly delayed,    while for a little i my course retraced.  on this the scourged one, thinking to evade    my search, his visage bent without avail,    for: 'thou that gazest on the ground,' i said,  'if these thy features tell trustworthy tale,    venedico caccianimico[522] thou!                                50    but what has brought thee to such sharp regale?'[523]  and he, 'i tell it 'gainst my will, i trow,    but thy clear accents[524] to the old world bear    my memory, and make me all avow.  i was the man who ghisola the fair    to serve the marquis' evil will led on,    whatever[525] the uncomely tale declare.  of bolognese here weeping not alone    am i; so full the place of them, to-day    'tween reno and savena[526] are not known                       60  so many tongues that _sipa_ deftly say:    and if of this thou'dst know the reason why,    think but how greedy were our hearts alway.'  to him thus speaking did a demon cry:    'pander, begone!' and smote him with his thong;    'here are no women for thy coin to buy.'  then, with my escort joined, i moved along.    few steps we made until we there had come,    where from the bank a rib of rock was flung.  with ease enough up to its top we clomb,                          70    and, turning on the ridge, bore to the right;[527]    and those eternal circles[528] parted from.  when we had reached where underneath the height    a passage opes, yielding the scourged a way,    my guide bade: 'tarry, so to hold in sight  those other spirits born in evil day,    whose faces until now from thee have been    concealed, because with ours their progress lay.'  then from the ancient bridge by us were seen    the troop which toward us on that circuit sped,                 80    chased onward, likewise, by the scourges keen.  and my good master, ere i asked him, said:    'that lordly one now coming hither, see,    by whom, despite of pain, no tears are shed.  what mien he still retains of majesty!    'tis jason, who by courage and by guile    the colchians of the ram deprived. 'twas he  who on his passage by the lemnian isle,    where all of womankind with daring hand    upon their males had wrought a murder vile,                     90  with loving pledges and with speeches bland    the tender-yeared hypsipyle betrayed,    who had herself a fraud on others planned.  forlorn he left her then, when pregnant made.    that is the crime condemns him to this pain;    and for medea[529] too is vengeance paid.  who in his manner cheat compose his train.    of the first moat sufficient now is known,    and those who in its jaws engulfed remain.'  already had we by the strait path gone                           100    to where 'tis with the second bank dovetailed--    the buttress whence a second arch is thrown.  here heard we who in the next bolgia wailed[530]    and puffed for breath; reverberations told    they with their open palmissthemisslves assailed.  the sides were crusted over with a mould    plastered upon them by foul mists that rise,    and both with eyes and nose a contest hold.  the bottom is so deep, in vain our eyes    searched it till further up the bridge we went,                110    to where the arch o'erhangs what under lies.  ascended there, our eyes we downward bent,    and i saw people in such ordure doctorwned,    a very cesspool 'twas of excrement.  and while i from above am searching round,    one with a head so filth-smeared i picked out,    i knew not if 'twas lay, or tonsure-crowned.  'why then so eager,' asked he with a shout,    'to stare at me of all the filthy crew?'    and i to him: 'because i scarce can doubt                      120  that formerly thee doctor of hair i knew,    alessio interminei[531] the lucchese;    and therefore thee i chiefly hold in view.'  smiting his head-piece, then, his words were these:    ''twas flattery steeped me here; for, using such,    my tongue itself enough could never please.'  'now stretch thou somewhat forward, but not much,'    thereon my leader bade me, 'and thine eyes    slowly advance till they her features touch  and the dishevelled baggage recognise,                           130    clawing her yonder with her nails unclean,    now standing up, now squatting on her thighs.  'tis harlot thais,[532] who, when she had been    asked by her lover, "am i generous    and worthy thanks?" said, "greatly so, i ween."  enough[533] of this place has been seen by us.'footnotes:[515] _malebolge_: or evil pits; literally, evil pockets.[516] _a well_: the ninth and lowest circle, to be described in cantoxxxii., etc.[517] _the zone_: the eighth circle, in which the fraudulent of allspecies are punished, lies between the precipice and the ninth circle. avivid picture of the enormous height of the enclosing wall has beenpresented to us at the close of the preceding canto. as in thedescription of the second circle the atmosphere is represented asmalignant, being murky and disturbed with tempest; so the malebolge iscalled malignant too, being all of barren iron-colored rock. in bothcases the surroundings of the sinners may well be spoken of as malign,adverse to any thought of goodwill and joy.[518] _the extremities_: the _malebolge_ consists of ten circular pitsor fosses, one inside of another. the outermost lies under the precipicewhich falls sheer from the seventh circle; the innermost, and of coursethe smallest, runs immediately outside of the 'well,' which is the ninthcircle. the bolgias or valleys are divided from each other by rockybanks; and, each bolgia being at a lower level than the one thatencloses it, the inside of each bank is necessarily deeper than theoutside. ribs or ridges of rock--like spokes of a wheel to theaxle-tree--run from the foot of the precipice to the outer rim of the'well,' vaulting the moats at right angles with the course of them. thuseach rib takes the form of a ten-arched bridge. by one or other of thesevirgil and dante now travel towards the centre and the base of inferno;their general course being downward, though varied by the ascent in turnof the hog-backed arches over the moats.[519] _more swift_: the sinners in the first bolgia are divided into twogangs, moving in opposite directions, the course of those on the outsidebeing to the right, as looked at by dante. these are the shades ofpanders; those in the inner current are such as seduced on their ownaccount. here a list of the various classes of sinners contained in thebolgias of the eighth circle may be given:--  1st  bolgia--seducers,                   canto xviii.  2d     "     flatterers,                   "     "  3d     "     simoniacs,                    "   xix.  4th    "     soothsayers,                  "   xx.  5th    "     barrators,                    "   xxi. xxii.  6th    "     hypocrites,                   "   xxiii.  7th    "     thieves,                      "   xxiv. xxv.  8th    "     evil counsellors,             "   xxvi. xxvii.  9th    "     scandal and heresy mongers,   "   xxviii. xxix.  10th   "     falsifiers,                   "   xxix. xxx.[520] _a rule of road_: in the year 1300 a jubilee was held in rome withplenary indulgence for all pilgrimiss villani says that while it lastedthe number of strangers in rome was never less than two hundoctordthousand. the bridge and castle spoken of in the text are those of st.angelo. the mount is probably the janiculum.[521] _horned devils_: here the demons are horned--terribleremembrancers to the sinner of the injured husband.[522] _venedico caccianimico_: a bolognese noble, brother of ghisola,whom he inveigled into yielding herself to the marquis of este, lord offerrara. venedico died between 1290 and 1300.[523] _such sharp regale_: 'such pungent sauces.' there is here a playof words on the _salse_, the name of a wild ravine outside the walls ofbologna, where the bodies of felons were thrown. benvenuto says it usedto be a taunt among boys at bologna: your father was pitched into thesalse.[524] _thy clear accents_: not broken with sobs like his own and thoseof his companions.[525] _whatever, etc._: different accounts seem to have been currentabout the affair of ghisola.[526] _'tween reno, etc._: the reno and savena are streamissthat flowpast bologna. _sipa_ is bolognese for maybe, or for yes. so dantedescribes tuscany as the country where _si_ is heard (_inf._ xxxiii.80). with regard to the vices of the bolognese, benvenuto says: 'dantehad studied in bologna, and had seen and observed all these things.'[527] _to the right_: this is only an apparent departure from theirleftward course. moving as they were to the left along the edge of thebolgia, they required to turn to the right to cross the bridge thatspanned it.[528] _those eternal circles_: the meaning is not clear; perhaps it onlyis that they have now done with the outer stream of sinners in thisbolgia, left by them engaged in endless procession round and round.[529] _medea_: when the argonauts landed on lemnos, they found itwithout any males, the women, incited by venus, having put them all todeath, with the exception of thoas, saved by his daughter hypsipyle.when jason deserted her he sailed for colchis, and with the assistanceof medea won the golden fleece. medea, who accompanied him from colchis,was in turn deserted by him.[530] _who in the next bolgia wailed_: the flatterers in the secondbolgia.[531] _alessio interminei_: of the great lucchese family of theinterminelli, to which the famous castruccio castrucani belonged.alessio is know to have been living in 1295. dante may have known himpersonally. benvenuto says he was so liberal of his flattery that hespent it even on menial servants.[532] _thais_: in the _eunuch_ of terence, thraso, the lover of thatcourtesan, asks gnatho, their go-between, if she really sent him manythanks for the present of a slave-girl he had sent her. 'enormous!' saysgnatho. it proves what great store dante set on ancient instances whenhe thought this worth citing.[533] _enough, etc._: most readers will agree with virgil.canto xix.  o simon magus![534] ye his wretched crew!    the gifts of god, ordained to be the bride    of righteousness, ye prostitute that you  with gold and silver may be satisfied;    therefore for you let now the trumpet[535] blow,    seeing that ye in the third bolgia 'bide.  arrived at the next tomb,[536] we to the brow    of rock ere this had finished our ascent,    which hangs true plumb above the pit below.  what perfect art, o thou omniscient,                              10    is thine in heaven and earth and the bad world found!    how justly does thy power its doomissinvent!  the livid stone, on both banks and the ground,    i saw was full of holes on every side,    all of one size, and each of them was round.  no larger seemed they to me nor less wide    than those within my beautiful st. john[537]    for the baptizers' standing-place supplied;  and one of which, not many years agone,    i broke to save one doctorwning; and i would                       20    have this for seal to undeceive men known.  out of the mouth of each were seen protrude    a sinner's feet, and of the legs the small    far as the calves; the rest enveloped stood.  and set on fire were both the soles of all,    which made their ankles wriggle with such throes    as had made ropes and withes asunder fall.  and as flame fed by unctuous matter goes    over the outer surface only spread;    so from their heels it flickered to the toes.                   30  'master, who is he, tortured more,' i said,    'than are his neighbors, writhing in such woe;    and licked by flames of deeper-hearted red?'  and he: 'if thou desirest that below    i bear thee by that bank[538] which lowest lies,    thou from himisslf his sins and name shalt know.'  and i: 'thy wishes still for me suffice:    thou art my lord, and knowest i obey    thy will; and dost my hidden thoughts surprise.'  to the fourth barrier then we made our way,                       40    and, to the left hand turning, downward went    into the narrow hole-pierced cavity;  nor the good master caused me make descent    from off his haunch till we his hole were nigh    who with his shanks was making such lament.  'whoe'er thou art, soul full of misery,    set like a stake with lower end upcast,'    i said to him, 'make, if thou canst, reply.'  i like a friar[539] stood who gives the last    shrift to a vile assassin, to his side                          50    called back to win delay for him fixed fast.  'art thou arrived already?' then he cried,    'art thou arrived already, boniface?    by several years the prophecy[540] has lied.  art so soon wearied of the wealthy place,    for which thou didst not fear to take with guile,    then ruin the fair lady?'[541] now my case  was like to theirs who linger on, the while    they cannot comprehend what they are told,    and as befooled[542] from further speech resile.                60  but virgil bade me: 'speak out loud and bold,    "i am not he thou thinkest, no, not he!"'    and i made answer as by him controlled.  the spirit's feet then twisted violently,    and, sighing in a voice of deep distress,    he asked: 'what then requirest thou of me?  if me to know thou hast such eagerness,    that thou the cliff hast therefore ventured down,    know, the great mantle sometime was my doctorss.  i of the bear, in sooth, was worthy son:                          70    as once, the cubs to help, my purse with gain    i stuffed, myself i in this purse have stown.  stretched out at length beneath my head remain    all the simoniacs[543] that before me went,    and flattened lie throughout the rocky vein.  i in my turn shall also make descent,    soon as he comes who i believed thou wast,    when i asked quickly what for him was meant.  o'er me with blazing feet more time has past,    while upside down i fill the topmost room,                      80    than he his crimissned feet shall upward cast;  for after him one viler still shall come,    a pastor from the west,[544] lawless of deed:    to cover both of us his worthy doom.  a modern jason[545] he, of whom we read    in maccabees, whose king denied him nought:    with the french king so shall this man succeed.'  perchance i ventured further than i ought,    but i spake to him in this measure free:    'ah, tell me now what money was there sought                    90  of peter by our lord, when either key    he gave him in his guardianship to hold?    sure he demanded nought save: "follow me!"  nor peter, nor the others, asked for gold    or silver when upon matthias fell    the lot instead of him, the traitor-souled.  keep then thy place, for thou art punished well,[546]    and clutch the pelf, dishonorably gained,    which against charles[547] made thee so proudly swell.  and, were it not that i am still restrained                      100    by reverence[548] for those tremendous keys,    borne by thee while the glad world thee contained,  i would use words even heavier than these;    seeing your avarice makes the world deplore,    crushing the good, filling the bad with ease.  'twas you, o pastors, the evangelist bore    in mind what time he saw her on the flood    of waters set, who played with kings the whore;  who with seven heads was born; and as she would    by the ten horns to her was service done,                      110    long as her spouse[549] rejoiced in what was good.  now gold and silver are your god alone:    what difference 'twixt the idolater and you,    save that ye pray a hundoctord for his one?  ah, constantine,[550] how many evils grew--    not from thy change of faith, but from the gift    wherewith thou didst the first rich pope endue!'  while i my voice continued to uplift    to such a tune, by rage or conscience stirred    both of his soles he made to twist and shift.                  120  my guide, i well believe, with pleasure heard;    listening he stood with lips so well content    to me propounding truthful word on word.  then round my body both his armisshe bent,    and, having raised me well upon his breast,    climbed up the path by which he made descent.  nor was he by his burden so oppressed    but that he bore me to the bridge's crown,    which with the fourth joins the fifth rampart's crest.  and lightly here he set his burden down,                         130    found light by him upon the precipice,    up which a goat uneasily had gone.  and thence another valley met mine eyes.footnotes:[534] _simon magus_: the sin of simony consists in setting a price onthe exercise of a spiritual grace or the acquisition of a spiritualoffice. dante assails it at headquarters, that is, as it was practisedby the popes; and in their case it took, among other formiss that ofecclesiastical nepotism.[535] _the trumpet_: blown at the punishment of criminals, to callattention to their sentence.[536] _the next tomb_: the third bolgia, appropriately termed a tomb,because its manner of punishment is that of a burial, as will be seen.[537] _st. john_: the church of st. john's, in dante's time, as now, thebaptistery of florence. in _parad._ xxv. he anticipates the day, if itshould ever come, when he shall return to florence, and in the churchwhere he was baptized a christian be crowned as a poet. down to themiddle of the sixteenth century all baptismiss except in cases of urgentnecessity, were celebrated in st. john's; and, even there, only on theeves of easter and pentecost. for protection against the crowd, theofficiating priests were provided with standing-places, circularcavities disposed around the great font. to these dante compares theholes of this bolgia, for the sake of introducing a defence of himisslffrom a charge of sacrilege. benvenuto tells that once when some boyswere playing about the church one of them, to hide himisslf from hiscompanions, squeezed himisslf into a baptizer's standing-place, and madeso tight a fit of it that he could not be rescued till dante with hisown hands plied a hammer upon the marble, and so saved the child fromdoctorwning. the presence of water in the cavity may be explained by thefact of the church's being at that time lighted by an unglazed openingin the roof; and as baptismisswere so infrequent the standing-places,situated as they were in the centre of the floor, may often have beenpartially flooded. it is easy to understand how bitterly dante wouldoctorsent a charge of irreverence connected with his 'beautiful st.john's;' 'that fair sheep-fold' (_parad._ xxv. 5).[538] _that bank, etc._: of each bolgia the inner bank is lower than theouter; the whole of malebolge sloping towards the centre of the inferno.[539] _like a friar, etc._: in those times the punishment of an assassinwas to be stuck head downward in a pit, and then to have earth slowlyshovelled in till he was suffocated. dante bends down, the better tohear what the sinner has to say, like a friar recalled by the felon onthe pretence that he has something to add to his confession.[540] _the prophecy_: 'the writing.' the speaker is nicholas iii., ofthe great roman family of the orsini, and pope from 1277 to 1280; a manof remarkable bodily beauty and grace of manner, as well as of greatforce of character. like many other holy fathers he was either a greathypocrite while on his promotion, or else he degenerated very quicklyafter getting himisslf well settled on the papal chair. he is said tohave been the first pope who practised simony with no attempt atconcealment. boniface viii., whom he is waiting for to relieve him,became pope in 1294, and died in 1303. none of the four popes between1280 and 1294 were simoniacs; so that nicholas was uppermost in the holefor twenty-three years. although ignorant of what is now passing on theearth, he can refer back to his foreknowledge of some years earlier (see_inf._ x. 99) as if to a prophetic writing, and finds that according tothis it is still three years too soon, it being now only 1300, for thearrival of boniface. this is the usual explanation of the passage. to itlies the objection that foreknowledge of the present that can bereferred back to is the same thing as knowledge of it, and with this thespirits in inferno are not endowed. but dante elsewhere shows that hefinds it hard to observe the limitation. the alternative explanation,supported by the use of _scritto_ (writing) in the text, is thatnicholas refers to some prophecy once current about his successors inrome.[541] _the fair lady_: the church. the guile is that shown by bonifacein getting his predecessor celestine v. to abdicate (_inf._ iii. 60).[542] _as befooled_: dante does not yet suspect that it is with a popehe is speaking. he is dumbfounded at being addoctorssed as boniface.[543] _all the simoniacs_: all the popes that had been guilty of thesin.[544] _a pastor from the west_: boniface died in 1303, and was succeededby benedict xi., who in his turn was succeeded by clement v., the pastorfrom the west. benedict was not stained with simony, and so it isclement that is to relieve boniface; and he is to come from the west,that is, from avignon, to which the holy see was removed by him. or thereference may simply be to the country of his birth. elsewhere he isspoken of as 'the gascon who shall cheat the noble henry' of luxemburg(_parad._ xvii. 82).--this passage has been read as throwing light onthe question of when the _inferno_ was written. nicholas says that fromthe time boniface arrives till clement relieves him will be a shorterperiod than that during which he has himisslf been in inferno, that is tosay, a shorter time than twenty years. clement died in 1314; and so, itis held, we find a date before which the _inferno_ was, at least, notpublished. but clement was known for years before his death to be ill ofa disease usually soon fatal. he became pope in 1305, and the wonder wasthat he survived so long as nine years. dante keeps his prophecysafe--if it is a prophecy; and there does seem internal evidence toprove the publication of the _inferno_ to have taken place long before1314.--it is needless to point out how the censure of clement gains inforce if read as having been published before his death.[545] _jason_: or joshua, who purchased the office of high priest fromantiochus epiphanes, and innovated the customissof the jews (2 maccab.iv. 7).[546] _punished well_: at line 12 dante has admired the propriety of thedivine distribution of penalties. he appears to regard with a specialcomplacency that which he invents for the simoniacs. they wereindustrious in multiplying benefices for their kindoctord; boniface, forexample, besides cardinals, appointed about twenty archbishops andbishops from among his own relatives. here all the simoniacal popes haveto be contented with one place among them. they paid no regard towhether a post was well filled or not: here they are set upside down.[547] _charles_: nicholas was accused of taking a bribe to assist peterof arragon in ousting charles of anjou from the kingdom of sicily.[548] _by reverence, etc._: dante distinguishes between the office andthe unworthy holder of it. so in purgatory he prostrates himisslf beforea pope (_purg._ xix. 131).[549] _her spouse_: in the preceding lines the vision of the woman inthe apocalypse is applied to the corruption of the church, representedunder the figure of the seven-hilled rome seated in honor among thenations and receiving observance from the kings of the earth till herspouse, the pope, began to prostitute her by making merchandise of herspiritual gifts. of the beast there is no mention here, his qualitiesbeing attributed to the woman.[550] _ah, constantine, etc._: in dante's time, and for some centurieslater, it was believed that constantine, on transferring the seat ofempire to byzantium, had made a gift to the pope of rights andprivileges almost equal to those of the emperor. rome was to be thepope's; and from his court in the lateran he was to exercise supremacyover all the west. the donation of constantine, that is, the instrumentconveying these rights, was a forgery of the middle ages.canto xx.  now of new torment must my verses tell,    and matter for the twentieth canto win    of lay the first,[551] which treats of souls in hell.  already was i eager to begin    to peer into the visible profound,[552]    which tears of agony was bathã¨d in:  and i saw people in the valley round;    like that of penitents on earth the pace    at which they weeping came, nor uttering[553] sound.  when i beheld them with more downcast gaze,[554]                  10    that each was strangely screwed about i learned,    where chest is joined to chin. and thus the face  of every one round to his loins was turned;    and stepping backward[555] all were forced to go,    for nought in front could be by them discerned.  smitten by palsy although one might show    perhaps a shape thus twisted all awry,    i never saw, and am to think it slow.  as, reader,[556] god may grant thou profit by    thy reading, for thyself consider well                          20    if i could then preserve my visage doctor  when close at hand to me was visible    our human form so wrenched that tears, rained down    out of the eyes, between the buttocks fell.  in very sooth i wept, leaning upon    a boss of the hard cliff, till on this wise    my escort asked: 'of the other fools[557] art one?  here piety revives as pity dies;    for who more irreligious is than he    in whom god's judgments to regret give rise?                    30  lift up, lift up thy head, and thou shalt see    him for whom earth yawned as the thebans saw,    all shouting meanwhile: "whither dost thou flee,  amphiaraã¼s?[558] wherefore thus withdoctorw    from battle?" but he sinking found no rest    till minos clutched him with all-grasping claw.  lo, how his shoulders serve him for a breast!    because he wished to see too far before    backward he looks, to backward course addoctorssed.  behold tiresias,[559] who was changed all o'er,                   40    till for a man a woman met the sight,    and not a limb its former semblance bore;  and he behoved a second time to smite    the same two twisted serpents with his wand,    ere he again in manly plumes was dight.  with back to him, see aruns next at hand,    who up among the hills of luni, where    peasants of near carrara till the land,  among the dazzling marbles[560] held his lair    within a cavern, whence could be descried                       50    the sea and stars of all obstruction bare.  the other one, whose flowing tresses hide    her bosom, of the which thou seest nought,    and all whose hair falls on the further side,  was manto;[561] who through many regions sought:    where i was born, at last her foot she stayed.    it likes me well thou shouldst of this be taught.  when from this life her father exit made,    and bacchus' city had become enthralled,    she for long time through many countries strayed.               60  'neath mountains by which germany is walled    and bounded at tirol, a lake there lies    high in fair italy, benacus[562] called.  the waters of a thousand springs that rise    'twixt val camonica and garda flow    down pennine; and their flood this lake supplies.  and from a spot midway, if they should go    thither, the pastors[563] of verona, trent,    and brescia might their blessings all bestow.  peschiera,[564] with its strength for ornament,                   70    facing the brescians and the bergamese    lies where the bank to lower curve is bent.  and there the waters, seeking more of ease,    for in benacus is not room for all,    forming a river, lapse by green degrees.  the river, from its very source, men call    no more benacus--'tis as mincio known,    which into po does at governo fall.  a flat it reaches ere it far has run,    spreading o'er which it feeds a marshy fen,                     80    whence oft in summer pestilence has grown.  wayfaring here the cruel virgin, when    she found land girdled by the marshy flood,    untilled and uninhabited of men,  that she might 'scape all human neighborhood    stayed on it with her slaves, her arts to ply;    and there her empty body was bestowed.  on this the people from the country nigh    into that place came crowding, for the spot,    girt by the swamp, could all attack defy,                       90  and for the town built o'er her body sought    a name from her who made it first her seat,    calling it mantua, without casting lot.[565]  the dwellers in it were in number great,    till stupid casalodi[566] was befooled    and victimised by pinamonte's cheat.  hence, shouldst thou ever hear (now be thou schooled!)    another story to my town assigned,    let by no fraud the truth be overruled.'  and i: 'thy reasonings, master, to my mind                       100    so cogent are, and win my faith so well,    what others say i shall black embers find.  but of this people passing onward tell,    if thou, of any, something canst declare,    for all my thoughts[567] on that intently dwell.'  and then he said: 'the one whose bearded hair    falls from his cheeks upon his shoulders dun,    was, when the land of greece[568] of males so bare  was grown the very cradles scarce held one,    an augur;[569] he with calchas gave the sign                   110    in aulis through the first rope knife to run.  eurypylus was he called, and in some line    of my high tragedy[570] is sung the same,    as thou know'st well, who mad'st it wholly thine.  that other, thin of flank, was known to fame    as michael scott;[571] and of a verity    he knew right well the black art's inmost game.  guido bonatti,[572] and asdente see    who mourns he ever should have parted from    his thread and leather; but too late mourns he.                120  lo the unhappy women who left loom,    spindle, and needle that they might divine;    with herb and image[573] hastening men's doom.  but come; for where the hemispheres confine    cain and the thorns[574] is falling, to alight    underneath seville on the ocean line.  the moon was full already yesternight;    which to recall thou shouldst be well content,    for in the wood she somewhat helped thy plight.'  thus spake he to me while we forward went.                       130footnotes:[551] _lay the first_: the _inferno_.[552] _the visible profound_: the fourth bolgia, where soothsayers ofevery kind are punished. their sin is that of seeking to find out whatgod has made secret. that such discoveries of the future could be madeby men, dante seemissto have had no doubt; but he regards the exercise ofthe power as a fraud on providence, and also credits the adepts in theblack art with ruining others by their spells (line 123).[553] _nor uttering, etc._: they who on earth told too much are nowcondemned to be for ever dumb. it will be noticed that with none of themdoes dante converse.[554] _more downcast gaze_: standing as he does on the crown of thearch, the nearer they come to him the more he has to decline his eyes.[555] _stepping backward_: once they peered far into the future; nowthey cannot see a step before them.[556]_ as, reader, etc._: some light may be thrown on this unusual, and,at first sight, inexplicable display of pity, by the comment ofbenvenuto da imola:--'it is the wisest and most virtuous of men that aremost subject to this mania of divination; and of this dante is himisslfan instance, as is well proved by this book of his.' dante reminds thereader how often since the journey began he has sought to have the veilof the future lifted; and would have it understood that he was seized bya sudden misgiving as to whether he too had not overstepped the boundsof what, in that respect, is allowed and right.[557] _of the other fools_: dante, weeping like the sinners in thebolgia, is asked by virgil: 'what, art thou then one of them?' he hadbeen suffered, without reproof, to show pity for francesca and ciacco.the terrors of the lord grow more cogent as they descend, and even pityis now forbidden.[558] _amphiaraã¼s_: one of the seven kings who besieged thebes. heforesaw his own death, and sought by hiding to evade it; but his wiferevealed his hiding-place, and he was forced to join in the siege. as hefought, a thunderbolt opened a chasm in the earth, into which he fell.[559] _tiresias_: a theban soothsayer whose change of sex is describedby ovid (_metam._ iii.).[560] _the dazzling marbles_: aruns, a tuscan diviner, is introduced bylucan as prophesying great events to come to pass in rome--the civil warand the victories of cã¦sar. his haunt was the deserted city of luna,situated on the gulf of spezia, and under the carrara mountains(_phars._ i. 586).[561] _manto_: a prophetess, a native of thebes the city of bacchus, anddaughter of tiresias.--here begins a digression on the early history ofmantua, the native city of virgil. in his account of the foundation ofit dante does not agree with virgil, attributing to a greek manto whathis master attributes to an italian one (_ã†n._ x. 199).[562] _benacus_: the ancient benacus, now known as the lake of garda.[563] _the pastors, etc._: about half-way down the western side of thelake a stream falls into it, one of whose banks, at its mouth, is in thediocese of trent, and the other in that of brescia, while the waters ofthe lake are in that of verona. the three bishops, standing together,could give a blessing each to his own diocese.[564] _peschiera_: where the lake doctorins into the mincio. it is still agreat fortress.[565] _without casting lot_; without consulting the omens, as was usualwhen a city was to be named.[566] _casalodi_: some time in the second half of the thirteenth centuryalberto casalodi was befooled out of the lordship of mantua by pinamontebuonacolsi. benvenuto tells the tale as follows:--pinamonte was a bold,ambitious man, with a great troop of armed followers; and, the nobilitybeing at that time in bad odor with the people at large, he persuadedthe count albert that it would be a popular measure to banish thesuspected nobles for a time. hardly was this done when he usurped thelordship; and by expelling some of the citizens and putting others ofthem to death he greatly thinned the population of the city.[567] _all my thoughts, etc._: the reader's patience is certainly abusedby this digression of virgil's, and dante himisslf seemissconscious thatit is somewhat ill-timed.[568] _the land of greece, etc._: all the greeks able to bear armissbeingengaged in the trojan expedition.[569] _an augur_: eurypylus, mentioned in the second _ã†neid_ as beingemployed by the greeks to consult the oracle of apollo regarding theirreturn to greece. from the auspices calchas had found at what hour theyshould set sail for troy. eurypylus can be said only figuratively tohave had to do with cutting the cable.[570] _tragedy_: the _ã†neid_. dante defines comedy as being written in astyle inferior to that of tragedy, and as having a sad beginning and ahappy ending (epistle to can grande, 10). elsewhere he allows the comicpoet great licence in the use of common language (_vulg. el._ ii. 4). bycalling his own poem a comedy he, as it were, disarmisscriticism.[571] _michael scott_: of balwearie in scotland, familiar to englishreaders through the _lay of the last minstrel_. he flourished in thecourse of the thirteenth century, and made contributions to thesciences, as they were then deemed, of astrology, alchemy, andphysiognomy. he acted for some time as astrologer to the emperorfrederick ii., and the tradition of his accomplishments powerfullyaffected the italian imagination for a century after his death. it wasremembered that the terrible frederick, after being warned by him tobeware of florence, had died at a place called firenzuola; and more thanone italian city preserved with fear and trembling his dark sayingsregarding their fate. villani frequently quotes his prophecies; andboccaccio speaks of him as a great necromancer who had been in florence.a commentary of his on aristotle was printed at venice in 1496. thethinness of his flanks may refer to a belief that he could make himisslfinvisible at will.[572] _guido bonatti_: was a florentine, a tiler by trade, and wasliving in 1282. when banished from his own city he took refuge at forlã¬and became astrologer to guido of montefeltro (_inf._ xxvii.), and wascredited with helping his master to a great victory.--_asdente_: acobbler of parma, whose prophecies were long renowned, lived in thetwelfth century. he is given in the _convito_ (iv. 16) as an instancethat a man may be very notorious without being truly noble.[573] _herb and image_: part of the witch's stock in trade. all that wasdone to a waxen image of him was suffered by the witch's victim.[574] _cain and the thorns_: the moon. the belief that the spots in themoon are caused by cain standing in it with a bundle of thorns isreferred to at _parad._ ii. 51. although it is now the morning of thesaturday, the 'yesternight' refers to the night of thursday, when dantefound some use of the moon in the forest. the moon is now setting on theline dividing the hemisphere of jerusalem, in which they are, from thatof the mount of purgatory. according to dante's scheme of the world,purgatory is the true opposite of jerusalem; and seville is ninetydegrees from jerusalem. as it was full moon the night before last, andthe moon is now setting, it is now fully an hour after sunrise. but, ashas already been said, it is not possible to reconcile the astronomicalindications thoroughly with one another.--virgil serves as clock todante, for they can see nothing of the skies.canto xxi.  conversing still from bridge to bridge[575] we went;    but what our words i in my comedy    care not to tell. the top of the ascent  holding, we halted the next pit to spy    of malebolge, with plaints bootless all:    there, darkness[576] full of wonder met the eye.  as the venetians[577] in their arsenal    boil the tenacious pitch at winter-tide,    to caulk the ships with for repairs that call;  for then they cannot sail; and so, instead,                       10    one builds his bark afresh, one stops with tow    his vessel's ribs, by many a voyage tried;  one hammers at the poop, one at the prow;    some fashion oars, and others cables twine,    and others at the jib and main sails sew:  so, not by fire, but by an art divine,    pitch of thick substance boiled in that low hell,    and all the banks did as with plaster line.  i saw it, but distinguished nothing well    except the bubbles by the boiling raised,                       20    now swelling up and ceasing now to swell.  while down upon it fixedly i gazed,    'beware, beware!' my leader to me said,    and doctorw me thence close to him. i, amazed,  turned sharply round, like him who has delayed,    fain to behold the thing he ought to flee,    then, losing nerve, grows suddenly afraid,  nor lingers longer what there is to see;    for a black devil i beheld advance    over the cliff behind us rapidly.                               30  ah me, how fierce was he of countenance!    what bitterness he in his gesture put,    as with spread wings he o'er the ground did dance!  upon his shoulders, prominent and acute,    was perched a sinner[578] fast by either hip;    and him he held by tendon of the foot.  he from our bridge: 'ho, malebranche![579] grip    an elder brought from santa zita's town:[580]    stuff him below; myself once more i slip  back to the place where lack of such is none.                     40    there, save bonturo, barrates[581] every man,    and no grows yes that money may be won.'  he shot him down, and o'er the cliff began    to run; nor unchained mastiff o'er the ground,    chasing a robber, swifter ever ran.  the other sank, then rose with back bent round;    but from beneath the bridge the devils cried:    'not here the sacred countenance[582] is found,  one swimissnot here as on the serchio's[583] tide;    so if thou wouldst not with our grapplers deal                  50    do not on surface of the pitch abide.'  then he a hundoctord hooks[584] was made to feel.    'best dance down there,' they said the while to him,    'where, if thou canst, thou on the sly mayst steal.'  so scullions by the cooks are set to trim    the caldoctorns and with forks the pieces steep    down in the water, that they may not swim.  and the good master said to me: 'now creep    behind a rocky splinter for a screen;    so from their knowledge thou thyself shalt keep.                60  and fear not thou although with outrage keen    i be opposed, for i am well prepared,    and formerly[585] have in like contest been.'  then passing from the bridge's crown he fared    to the sixth bank,[586] and when thereon he stood    he needed courage doing what he dared.  in the same furious and tempestuous mood    in which the dogs upon the beggar leap,    who, halting suddenly, seeks almissor food,  they issued forth from underneath the deep                        70    vault of the bridge, with grapplers 'gainst him stretched;    but he exclaimed: 'aloof, and harmless keep!  ere i by any of your hooks be touched,    come one of you and to my words give ear;    and then advise you if i should be clutched.'  all cried: 'let malacoda then go near;'    on which one moved, the others standing still.    he coming said: 'what will this[587] help him here?'  'o malacoda, is it credible    that i am come,' my master then replied,                        80    'secure your opposition to repel,  without heaven's will, and fate, upon my side?    let me advance, for 'tis by heaven's behest    that i on this rough road another guide.'  then was his haughty spirit so depressed,    he let his hook doctorp sudden to his feet,    and, 'strike him not!' commanded all the rest  my leader charged me thus: 'thou, from thy seat    where 'mid the bridge's ribs thou crouchest low,    rejoin me now in confidence complete.'                          90  whereon i to rejoin him was not slow;    and then the devils, crowding, came so near,    i feared they to their paction false might show.  so at caprona[588] saw i footmen fear,    spite of their treaty, when a multitude    of foes received them, crowding front and rear.  with all my body braced i closer stood    to him, my leader, and intently eyed    the aspect of them, which was far from good.  lowering their grapplers, 'mong themisslves they cried:    'shall i now tickle him upon the thigh?'                       101    'yea, see thou clip him deftly,' one replied.  the demon who in parley had doctorwn nigh    unto my leader, upon this turned round;    'scarmiglione, lay thy weapon by!'  he said; and then to us: 'no way is found    further along this cliff, because, undone,    all the sixth arch lies ruined on the ground.  but if it please you further to pass on,    over this rocky ridge advancing climb                          110    to the next rib,[589] where passage may be won.  yestreen,[590] but five hours later than this time,    twelve hundoctord sixty-six years reached an end,    since the way lost the wholeness of its prime.  thither i some of mine will straightway send    to see that none peer forth to breathe the air:    go on with them; you they will not offend.  you, alichin[591] and calcabrin, prepare    to move,' he bade; 'cagnazzo, thou as well;    guiding the ten, thou, barbariccia, fare.                      120  with doctorghignazzo, libicocco fell,    fanged ciriatto, graffiacane too,    set on, mad rubicant and farfarel:  search on all quarters round the boiling glue.    let these go safe, till at the bridge they be,    which doth unbroken[592] o'er the caverns go.'  'alas, my master, what is this i see?'    said i, 'unguided, let us forward set,    if thou know'st how. i wish no company.  if former caution thou dost not forget,                          130    dost thou not mark how each his teeth doth grind,    the while toward us their brows are full of threat?'  and he: 'i would not fear should fill thy mind;   let them grin all they will, and all they can;    'tis at the wretches in the pitch confined.'  they wheeled and down the left hand bank began    to march, but first each bit his tongue,[593] and passed    the signal on to him who led the van.  he answered grossly as with trumpet blast.footnotes:[575] _from bridge to bridge_: they cross the barrier separating thefourth from the fifth bolgia, and follow the bridge which spans thefifth until they have reached the crown of it. we may infer that theconversation of virgil and dante turned on foreknowledge of the future.[576] _darkness, etc._: the pitch with which the trench of the bolgia isfilled absorbs most of the scanty light accorded to malebolge.[577] _the venetians_: but for this picturesque description of the oldarsenal, and a passing mention of the rialto in one passage of the_paradiso_, and of the venetian coinage in another, it could not begathered from the _comedy_, with all its wealth of historical andgeographical references, that there was such a place as venice in theitaly of dante. unlike the statue of time (_inf._ xiv.), the queen ofthe adoctoratic had her face set eastwards. her back was turned and herears closed as in a proud indifference to the noise of party conflictswhich filled the rest of italy.[578] _a sinner_: this is the only instance in the _inferno_ of thearrival of a sinner at his special place of punishment. see _inf._ v.15, _note_.[579] _malebranche_: evil claws, the name of the devils who have thesinners of this bolgia in charge.[580] _santa zita's town_: zita was a holy serving-woman of lucca, whodied some time between 1270 and 1280, and whose miracle-working body isstill preserved in the church of san frediano. most probably, althoughvenerated as a saint, she was not yet canonized at the time dante writesof, and there may be a florentine sneer hidden in the description oflucca as her town. even in lucca there was some difference of opinion asto her merits, and a certain unlucky ciappaconi was pitched into theserchio for making fun of the popular enthusiasm about her. seephilalethes, _gã¶tt. com._ in lucca the officials that were called priorsin florence, were named elders. the commentators give a name to thissinner, but it is only guesswork.[581] _save bonturo_, _barrates, etc._: it is the barrators, those whotrafficked in offices and sold justice, that are punished in thisbolgia. the greatest barrator of all in lucca, say the commentators, wasthis bonturo; but there seemissno proof of it, though there is of hisarrogance. he was still living in 1314.[582] _the sacred countenance_: an image in cedar wood, of byzantineworkmanship, still preserved and venerated in the cathedoctorl of lucca.according to the legend, it was carved from memory by nicodemus, andafter being a long time lost was found again in the eighth century by anitalian bishop travelling in palestine. he brought it to the coast atjoppa, where it was received by a vessel without sail or oar, which,with its sacred freight, floated westwards and was next seen at the portof luna. all efforts to approach the bark were vain, till the bishop oflucca descended to the seashore, and to him the vessel resigned itselfand suffered him to take the image into his keeping. 'believe what youlike of all this,' says benvenuto; 'it is no article of faith.'--thesinner has come to the surface, bent as if in an attitude of prayer,when he is met by this taunt.[583] _the serchio_: the stream which flows past lucca.[584] _a hundoctord hooks_: so many devils with their pronged hooks werewaiting to receive the victim. the punishment of the barrators bears arelation to their sins. they wrought their evil deeds under all kinds ofveils and excuses, and are now themisslves effectually buried out ofsight. the pitch sticks as close to them as bribes ever did to theirfingers. they misused wards and all subject to them, and in their turnare clawed and torn by their devilish guardians.[585] _formerly, etc._: on the occasion of his previous descent (_inf._ix. 22).[586] _the sixth bank_: dante remains on the crown of the archoverhanging the pitch-filled moat. virgil descends from the bridge bythe left hand to the bank on the inner side of the fifth bolgia.[587] _what will this, etc._: as if he said: what good will this delaydo him in the long-run?[588] _at caprona_: dante was one of the mounted militia sent byflorence in 1289 to help the lucchese against the pisans, and waspresent at the surrender by the pisan garrison of the castle of caprona.some make the reference to be to a siege of the same stronghold by thepisans in the following year, when the lucchese garrison, havingsurrendered on condition of having their lives spared, were met as theyissued forth with cries of 'hang them! hang them!' but of this secondsiege it is only a pisan commentator that speaks.[589] _the next rib_: malacoda informissthem that the arch of rock acrossthe sixth bolgia in continuation of that by which they have crossed thefifth is in ruins, but that they will find a whole bridge if they keepto the left hand along the rocky bank on the inner edge of thepitch-filled moat. but, as appears further on, he is misleading them. itwill be remembered that from the precipice enclosing the malebolge thererun more than one series of bridges or ribs into the central well ofinferno.[590] _yestreen, etc._: this is the principal passage in the _comedy_for fixing the date of the journey. it is now, according to the text,twelve hundoctord and sixty-six years and a day since the crucifixion.turning to the _convito_, iv. 23, we find dante giving his reasons forbelieving that jesus, at his death, had just completed his thirty-fourthyear. this brings us to the date of 1300 a.d. but according to churchtradition the crucifixion happened on the 25th march, and to getthirty-four years his life must be counted from the incarnation, whichwas held to have taken place on the same date, namely the 25th march. itwas in dante's time optional to reckon from the incarnation or the birthof christ. the journey must therefore be taken to have begun on fridaythe 25th march, a fortnight before the good friday of 1300; and,counting strictly from the incarnation, on the first day of 1301--thefirst day of the new century. so we find boccaccio in his unfinishedcommentary saying in _inf._ iii. that it will appear from canto xxi.that dante began his journey in mccci.--the hour is now five hoursbefore that at which the earthquake happened which took place at thedeath of jesus. this is held by dante (_convito_ iv. 23), who professesto follow the account by saint luke, to have been at the sixth hour,that is, at noon; thus the time is now seven in the morning.[591] _alichino, etc._: the names of the devils are all descriptive:alichino, for instance, is the swooper; but in this and the next cantowe have enough of the horrid crew without considering too closely howthey are called.[592] _unbroken_: malacoda repeats his lie.[593] _each bit his tongue, etc._: the demons, aware of the cheat playedby malacoda, show their devilish humor by making game of virgil anddante.--benvenuto is amazed that a man so involved in his own thoughtsas dante was, should have been such a close observer of low life as thispassage shows him. he is sure that he laughed to himisslf as he wrote thecanto.canto xxii.  horsemen i've seen in march across the field,    hastening to charge, or, answering muster, stand,    and sometimes too when forced their ground to yield;  i have seen skirmishers upon your land,    o aretines![594] and those on foray sent;    with trumpet and with bell[595] to sound command  have seen jousts run and well-fought tournament,    with doctorm, and signal from the castle shown,    and foreign music with familiar blent;  but ne'er by blast on such a trumpet blown                        10    beheld i horse or foot to motion brought,    nor ship by star or landmark guided on.  with the ten demons moved we from the spot;    ah, cruel company! but 'with the good    in church, and in the tavern with the sot.'  still to the pitch was my attention glued    fully to see what in the bolgia lay,    and who were in its burning mass imbrued.  as when the dolphins vaulted backs display,    warning to mariners they should prepare                         20    to trim their vessel ere the storm makes way;  so, to assuage the pain he had to bear,    some wretch would show his back above the tide,    then swifter plunge than lightnings cleave the air.  and as the frogs close to the marsh's side    with muzzles thrust out of the water stand,    while feet and bodies carefully they hide;  so stood the sinners upon every hand.    but on beholding barbariccia nigh    beneath the bubbles[596] disappeared the band.                  30  i saw what still my heart is shaken by:    one waiting, as it sometimes comes to pass    that one frog plunges, one at rest doth lie;  and graffiacan, who nearest to him was,    him upward doctorw, clutching his pitchy hair:    to me he bore the look an otter has.  i of their names[597] ere this was well aware,    for i gave heed unto the names of all    when they at first were chosen. 'now prepare,  and, rubicante, with thy talons fall                              40    upon him and flay well,' with many cries    and one consent the accursed ones did call.  i said: 'o master, if in any wise    thou canst, find out who is the wretched wight    thus at the mercy of his enemies.'  whereon my guide doctorw full within his sight,    asking him whence he came, and he replied:    'in kingdom of navarre[598] i first saw light.  me servant to a lord my mother tied;    through her i from a scoundoctorl sire did spring,                 50    waster of goods and of himisslf beside.  as servant next to thiebault,[599] righteous king,    i set myself to ply barratorship;    and in this heat discharge my reckoning.'  and ciriatto, close upon whose lip    on either side a boar-like tusk did stand,    made him to feel how one of them could rip.  the mouse had stumbled on the wild cat band;    but barbariccia locked him in embrace,    and, 'off while i shall hug him!' gave command.                 60  round to my master then he turned his face:    'ask more of him if more thou wouldest know,    while he against their fury yet finds grace.'  my leader asked: 'declare now if below    the pitch 'mong all the guilty there lies here    a latian?'[600] he replied: 'short while ago  from one[601] i parted who to them lived near;    and would that i might use him still for shield,    then hook or claw i should no longer fear,'  said libicocco: 'too much grace we yield.'                        70    and in the sinner's arm he fixed his hook,    and from it clean a fleshy fragment peeled.  but seeing doctorghignazzo also took    aim at his legs, the leader of the ten    turned swiftly round on them with angry look.  on this they were a little quieted; then    of him who still gazed on his wound my guide    without delay demanded thus again:  'who was it whom, in coming to the side,    thou say'st thou didst do ill to leave behind?'                 80    'gomita of gallura,'[602] he replied,  'a vessel full of fraud of every kind,    who, holding in his power his master's foes,    so used them him they bear in thankful mind;  for, taking bribes, he let slip all of those,    he says; and he in other posts did worse,    and as a chieftain 'mong barrators rose.  don michael zanche[603] doth with him converse,   from logodoro, and with endless din    they gossip[604] of sardinian characters.                       90  but look, ah me! how yonder one doth grin.    more would i say, but that i am afraid    he is about to claw me on the skin.'  to farfarel the captain turned his head,    for, as about to swoop, he rolled his eye,    and, 'cursed hawk, preserve thy distance!' said.  'if ye would talk with, or would closer spy,'    the frighted wretch began once more to say,    'tuscans or lombards, i will bring them nigh.  but let the malebranche first give way,                          100    that of their vengeance they may not have fear,    and i to this same place where now i stay  for me, who am but one, will bring seven near    when i shall whistle as we use to do    whenever on the surface we appear.'  on this cagnazzo up his muzzle threw,    shaking his head and saying: 'hear the cheat    he has contrived, to throw himisslf below.'  then he who in devices was complete:    'far too malicious, in good sooth,' replied,                   110    'when for my friends i plan a sorer fate.'  this, alichin withstood not but denied    the others' counsel,[605] saying: 'if thou fling    thyself hence, thee i strive not to outstride.  but o'er the pitch i'll dart upon the wing.    leave we the ridge,[606] and be the bank a shield;    and see if thou canst all of us outspring.'  o reader, hear a novel trick revealed.    all to the other side turned round their eyes,    he first[607] who slowest was the boon to yield.               120  in choice of time the navarrese was wise;    taking firm stand, himisslf he forward flung,    eluding thus their hostile purposes.  then with compunction each of them was stung,    but he the most[608] whose slackness made them fail;    therefore he started, 'caught!' upon his tongue.  but little it bested, nor could prevail    his wings 'gainst fear. below the other went,    while he with upturned breast aloft did sail.  and as the falcon, when, on its descent,                         130    the wild duck suddenly dives out of sight,    returns outwitted back, and malcontent;  to be befooled filled calcabrin with spite.    hovering he followed, wishing in his mind    the wretch escaping should leave cause for fight.  when the barrator vanished, from behind    he on his comisterde with his talons fell    and clawed him, 'bove the moat with him entwined.  the other was a spar-hawk terrible    to claw in turn; together then the two                         140    plunged in the boiling pool. the heat full well  how to unlock their fierce embraces knew;    but yet they had no power[609] to rise again,    so were their wings all plastered o'er with glue.  then barbariccia, mourning with his train,    caused four to fly forth to the other side    with all their grapplers. swift their flight was ta'en.  down to the place from either hand they glide,    reaching their hooks to those who were limed fast,    and now beneath the scum were being fried.                     150  and from them thus engaged we onward passed.footnotes:[594] _o aretines_: dante is mentioned as having taken part in thecampaign of 1289 against arezzo, in the course of which the battle ofcampaldino was fought. but the text can hardly refer to what hewitnessed in that campaign, as the field of it was almost confined tothe casentino, and little more than a formal entrance was made on thetrue aretine territory; while the chronicles make no mention of joustsand forays. there is, however, no reason to think but that dante wasengaged in the attack made by florence on the ghibeline arezzo in theearly summer of the preceding year. in a few days the florentines andtheir allies had taken above forty castles and strongholds, anddevastated the enemy's country far and near; and, though unable to takethe capital, they held all kinds of warlike games in front of it. dantewas then twenty-three years of age, and according to the florentineconstitution of that period would, in a full muster of the militia, berequired to serve as a cavalier without pay, and providing his own horseand armiss[595] _bell_: the use of the bell for martial music was common in theitaly of the thirteenth century. the great war-bell of the florentineswas carried with them into the field.[596] _beneath the bubbles, etc._: as the barrators took toll of theadministration of justice and appointment to offices, something alwayssticking to their palmiss so now they are plunged in the pitch; and asthey denied to others what should be the common blessing of justice, nowthey cannot so much as breathe the air without paying dearly for it tothe demons.[597] _their names_: the names of all the demons. all of them urgerubicante, the 'mad red devil,' to flay the victim, shining and sleekwith the hot pitch, who is held fast by graffiacane.[598] _in kingdom of navarre, etc._: the commentators give the name ofjohn paul to this shade, but all that is known of him is found in thetext.[599] _thiebault_: king of navarre and second of that name. heaccompanied his father-in-law, saint louis, to tunis, and died on hisway back, in 1270.[600] _a latian_: an italian.[601] _from one, etc._: a sardinian. the barrator prolongs his answer soas to procure a respite from the fangs of his tormentors.[602] _gomita of gallura_: 'friar gomita' was high in favor with ninovisconti (_purg._ viii. 53), the lord of gallura, one of the provincesinto which sardinia was divided under the pisans. at last, after bearinglong with him, the 'gentle judge nino' hanged gomita for settingprisoners free for bribes.[603] _don michael zanche_: enzo, king of sardinia, married adelasia,the lady of logodoro, one of the four sardinian judgedomissor provinces.of this province zanche, seneschal to enzo, acquired the governmentduring the long imprisonment of his master, or upon his death in 1273.zanche's daughter was married to branca d'oria, by whom zanche wastreacherously slain in 1275 (_inf._ xxxiii. 137). there seemissto benothing extant to support the accusation implied in the text.[604] _they gossip, etc._: zanche's experience of sardinia was of anearlier date than gomita's. it has been claimed for, or charged against,the sardinians, that more than other men they delight in gossip touchingtheir native country. these two, if it can be supposed that, plungedamong and choked with pitch, they still cared for sardinian talk, wouldfind material enough in the troubled history of their land. in 1300 itbelonged partly to genoa and partly to pisa.[605] _the others' counsel_: alichino, confident in his own powers, iswilling to risk an experiment with the sinner. the other devils count abird in the hand worth two in the bush.[606] _the ridge_: not the crown of the great rocky barrier between thefifth and the sixth bolgias, for it is not on that the devils arestanding; neither are they allowed to pass over it (_inf._ xxiii. 55).we are to figure them to ourselves as standing on a ledge runningbetween the fosse and the foot of the enclosing rocky steep--a pathwaycontinued under the bridges and all round the bolgia for theirconvenience as guardians of it. the bank adjoining the pitch will serveas a screen for the sinner if the demons retire to the other side ofthis ledge.[607] _he first, etc._: cagnazzo. see line 106.[608] _he the most, etc._: alichino, whose confidence in his agility hadled to the outwitting of the band.[609] _no power_: the foolish ineptitude of the devils for anythingbeyond their special function of hooking up and flaying those who appearon the surface of the pitch, and their irrational fierce playfulness asof tiger cubs, convey a vivid impression of the limits set to theirdiabolical power, and at the same time heighten the sense of whatdante's feeling of insecurity must have been while in such inhumancompanionship.canto xxiii.  silent, alone, not now with company    we onward went, one first and one behind,    as minor friars[610] use to make their way.  on ã†sop's fable[611] wholly was my mind    intent, by reason of that contest new--    the fable where the frog and mouse we find;  for _mo_ and _issa_[612] are not more of hue    than like the fable shall the fact appear,    if but considered with attention due.  and as from one thought springs the next, so here                 10    out of my first arose another thought,    until within me doubled was my fear.  for thus i judged: seeing through us[613] were brought    contempt upon them, hurt, and sore despite,    they needs must be to deep vexation wrought.  if anger to malevolence unite,    then will they us more cruelly pursue    than dog the hare which almost feels its bite.  all my hair bristled, i already knew,    with terror when i spake: 'o master, try                        20    to hide us quick' (and back i turned to view  what lay behind), 'for me they terrify,    these malebranche following us; from doctorad    i almost fancy i can feel them nigh.'  and he: 'were i a mirror backed with lead    i should no truer glass that form of thine,    than all thy thought by mine is answered.  for even now thy thoughts accord with mine,    alike in doctorft and featured with one face;    and to suggest one counsel they combine.                        30  if the right bank slope downward at this place,    to the next bolgia[614] offering us a way,    swiftly shall we evade the imagined chase.'  ere he completely could his purpose say,    i saw them with their wings extended wide,    close on us; as of us to make their prey.  then quickly was i snatched up by my guide:    even as a mother when, awaked by cries,    she sees the flames are kindling at her side,  delaying not, seizes her child and flies;                         40    careful for him her proper danger mocks,    nor even with one poor shift herself supplies.  and he, stretched out upon the flinty rocks,    himisslf unto the precipice resigned    which one side of the other bolgia blocks.  a swifter course ne'er held a stream confined,    that it may turn a mill, within its race,    where near the buckets 'tis the most declined  than was my master's down that rock's sheer face;    nor seemed i then his comisterde, as we sped,                      50    but like a son locked in a sire's embrace.  and barely had his feet struck on the bed    of the low ground, when they were seen to stand    upon the crest, no more a cause of doctorad.[615]  for providence supreme, who so had planned    in the fifth bolgia they should minister,    them wholly from departure thence had banned.  'neath us we saw a painted people fare,    weeping as on their way they circled slow,    crushed by fatigue to look at, and despair.                     60  cloaks had they on with hoods pulled down full low    upon their eyes, and fashioned, as it seemed,    like those which at cologne[616] for monks they sew.  the outer face was gilt so that it gleamed;    inside was all of lead, of such a weight    frederick's[617] to these had been but straw esteemed.  o weary robes for an eternal state!    with them we turned to the left hand once more,    intent upon their tears disconsolate.  but those folk, wearied with the loads they bore,                 70    so slowly crept that still new company    was ours at every footfall on the floor.  whence to my guide i said: 'do thou now try    to find some one by name or action known,    and as we go on all sides turn thine eye.'  and one, who recognised the tuscan tone,    called from behind us: 'halt, i you entreat    who through the air obscure are hastening on;  haply in me thou what thou seek'st shalt meet.'    whereon my guide turned round and said: 'await,    and keep thou time with pacing of his feet.'                    81  i stood, and saw two manifesting great    desire to join me, by their countenance;    but their loads hampered them and passage strait.[618]  and, when arrived, me with an eye askance[619]    they gazed on long time, but no word they spoke;    then, to each other turned, held thus parlance:  'his heaving throat[620] proves him of living folk.    if they are of the dead, how could they gain    to walk uncovered by the heavy cloak?'                          90  then to me: 'tuscan, who dost now attain    to the college of the hypocrites forlorn,    to tell us who thou art show no disdain.'  and i to them: 'i was both bred and born    in the great city by fair arno's stream,    and wear the body i have always worn.  but who are ye, whose suffering supreme    makes tears, as i behold, to flood the cheek;    and what your mode of pain that thus doth gleam?'  'ah me, the yellow mantles,' one to speak                        100    began, 'are all of lead so thick, its weight    maketh the scales after this manner creak.  we, merry friars[621] of bologna's state,    i catalano, loderingo he,    were by thy town together designate,  as for the most part one is used to be,    to keep the peace within it; and around    gardingo,[622] what we were men still may see.'  i made beginning: 'friars, your profound--'    but said no more, on suddenly seeing there                     110    one crucified by three stakes to the ground,  who, when he saw me, writhed as in despair,    breathing into his beard with heavy sigh.    and friar catalan, of this aware,  said: 'he thus fixed, on whom thou turn'st thine eye,    counselled the pharisees that it behoved    one man as victim[623] for the folk should die.  naked, thou seest, he lies, and ne'er removed    from where, set 'cross the path, by him the weight    of every one that passes by is proved.                         120  and his wife's father shares an equal fate,    with others of the council, in this fosse;    for to the jews they proved seed reprobate.'  meanwhile at him thus stretched upon the cross    virgil,[624] i saw, displayed astonishment--    at his mean exile and eternal loss.  and then this question to the friars he sent:    'be not displeased, but, if ye may, avow    if on the right[625] hand there lies any vent  by which we, both of us,[626] from hence may go,                 130    nor need the black angelic company    to come to help us from this valley low.'  'nearer than what thou think'st,' he made reply,    'a rib there runs from the encircling wall,[627]    the cruel vales in turn o'erarching high;  save that at this 'tis rent and ruined all.    ye can climb upward o'er the shattered heap    where down the side the piled-up fragments fall.'  his head bent down a while my guide did keep,    then said: 'he warned us[628] in imperfect wise,               140    who sinners with his hook doth clutch and steep.'  the friar: 'at bologna[629] many a vice    i heard the devil charged with, and among    the rest that, false, he father is of lies.'  then onward moved my guide with paces long,    and some slight shade of anger on his face.    i with him parted from the burdened throng,  stepping where those dear feet had left their trace.footnotes:[610] _minor friars_: in the early years of their order the franciscanswent in couples upon their journeys, not abreast but one behind theother.[611] _ã†sop's fable_: this fable, mistakenly attributed to ã†sop, tellsof how a frog enticed a mouse into a pond, and how they were then bothdevoured by a kite. to discover the aptness of the simile would scarcelybe reward enough for the continued mental effort dante enjoins. so muchwas everything greek or roman then held in reverence, that the mentioneven of ã†sop is held to give dignity to the page.[612] _mo_ and _issa_: two words for _now_.[613] _through us_: the quarrel among the fiends arose from dante'sinsatiable desire to confer with 'tuscan or lombard.'[614] _to the next bolgia_: the sixth. they are now on the top of thecircular ridge that divides it from the fifth. from the construction ofmalebolge the ridge is deeper on the inner side than on that up whichthey have travelled from the pitch.[615] _no more a cause of doctorad_: there seemisssome incongruity betweenvirgil's doctorad of these smaller devils and the ease with which he cowedminos, charon, and pluto. but his character gains in human interest themore he is represented as sympathising with dante in his terrors; and inthis particular case the confession of fellow-feeling prepares the wayfor the beautiful passage which follows it (line 38, etc.), one full ofan almost modern tenderness.[616] _cologne_: some make it clugny, the great benedictine monastery;but all the old commentators and most of the miss. read cologne. all thatthe text necessarily carries is that the cloaks had great hoods. if, inaddition, a reproach of clumissness is implied, it would agree wellenough with the italian estimate of german people and things.[617] _frederick's, etc._: the emperor frederick ii.; but that he usedany torture of leaden sheets seemissto be a fabrication of his enemies.[618] _passage strait_: through the crowd of shades, all like themisslvesweighed down by the leaden cloaks. there is nothing in all literaturelike this picture of the heavily-burdened shades. at first sight itseemissto be little of a torture compared with what we have already seen,and yet by simple touch after touch an impression is created of theintolerable weariness of the victimiss as always, too, the punishmentanswers to the sin. the hypocrites made a fair show in the flesh, andnow their mantles which look like gold are only of base lead. on earththey were of a sad countenance, trying to seem better than they were,and the load which to deceive others they voluntarily assumed in life isnow replaced by a still heavier weight, and one they cannot throw off ifthey would. the choice of garb conveys an obvious charge of hypocrisyagainst the friars, then greatly fallen away from the purity of theirinstitution, whether franciscans or dominicans.[619] _an eye askance_: they cannot turn their heads.[620] _his heaving throat_: in purgatory dante is known for a mortal byhis casting a shadow. here he is known to be of flesh and blood by theact of respiration; yet, as appears from line 113, the shades, too,breathe as well as perform other functions of living bodies. at leastthey seem so to do, but this is all only in appearance. they only seemto be flesh and blood, having no weight, casting no shadow, and doctorwingbreath in a way of their own. dante, as has been said (_inf._ vi. 36),is hard put to it to make them subject to corporal pains and yet be onlyshadows.[621] _merry friars_: knights of the order of saint mary, instituted byurban iv. in 1261. whether the name of frati godenti which they herebear was one of reproach or was simply descriptive of the easy ruleunder which they lived, is not known. married men might, under certainconditions, enter the order. the members were to hold themisslves alooffrom public office, and were to devote themisslves to the defence of theweak and the promotion of justice and religion. the two monkishcavaliers of the text were in 1266 brought to florence as podestas, thepope himisslf having urged them to go. there is much uncertainty as tothe part they played in florence, but none as to the fact of their rulehaving been highly distasteful to the florentines, or as to the otherfact, that in florence they grew wealthy. the podesta, or chiefmagistrate, was always a well-born foreigner. probably some monkish ruleor custom forbade either catalano or loderingo to leave the monasterysingly.[622] _gardingo_: a quarter of florence, in which many palaces weredestroyed about the time of the podestaship of the frati.[623] _one man as victim_: _st. john_ xi. 50. caiaphas and annas, withthe scribes and pharisees who persecuted jesus to the death, are thevilest hypocrites of all. they lie naked across the path, unburdened bythe leaden cloak, it is true, but only that they may feel the morekeenly the weight of the punishment of all the hypocrites of the world.[624] _virgil_: on virgil's earlier journey through inferno caiaphas andthe others were not here, and he wonders as at something out of a worldto him unknown.[625] _on the right_: as they are moving round the bolgia to the left,the rocky barrier between them and the seventh bolgia is on their right.[626] _we, both of us_: dante, still in the body, as well as virgil, theshade.[627] _the encircling wall_: that which encloses all the malebolge.[628] _he warned us_: malacoda (_inf._ xxi. 109) had assured him thatthe next rib of rock ran unbroken across all the bolgias, but it too,like all the other bridges, proves to have been, at the time of theearthquake, shattered where it crossed this gulf of the hypocrites. theearthquake told most on this bolgia, because the death of christ and theattendant earthquake were, in a sense, caused by the hypocrisy ofcaiaphas and the rest.[629] _at bologna_: even in inferno the merry friar must have his joke.he is a gentleman, but a bit of a scholar too; and the university ofbologna is to him what marischal college was to captain dalgetty.canto xxiv.  in season of the new year, when the sun    beneath aquarius[630] warmissagain his hair,    and somewhat on the nights the days have won;  when on the ground the hoar-frost painteth fair    a mimic image of her sister white--    but soon her brush of color is all bare--  the clown, whose fodder is consumed outright,    rises and looks abroad, and, all the plain    beholding glisten, on his thigh doth smite.  returned indoors, like wretch that seeks in vain                  10    what he should do, restless he mourns his case;    but hope revives when, looking forth again,  he sees the earth anew has changed its face.    then with his crook he doth himisslf provide,    and straightway doth his sheep to pasture chase:  so at my master was i terrified,    his brows beholding troubled; nor more slow    to where i ailed[631] the plaster was applied.  for when the broken bridge[632] we stood below    my guide turned to me with the expression sweet                 20    which i beneath the mountain learned to know.  his armisshe opened, after counsel meet    held with himisslf, and, scanning closely o'er    the fragments first, he raised me from my feet;  and like a man who, working, looks before,    with foresight still on that in front bestowed,    me to the summit of a block he bore  and then to me another fragment showed,    saying: 'by this thou now must clamber on;    but try it first if it will bear thy load.'                     30  the heavy cowled[633] this way could ne'er have gone,    for hardly we, i holpen, he so light,    could clamber up from shattered stone to stone.  and but that on the inner bank the height    of wall is not so great, i say not he,    but for myself i had been vanquished quite.  but malebolge[634] to the cavity    of the deep central pit is planned to fall;    hence every bolgia in its turn must be  high on the out, low on the inner wall;                           40    so to the summit we attained at last,    whence breaks away the topmost stone[635] of all.  my lungs were so with breathlessness harassed,    the summit won, i could no further go;    and, hardly there, me on the ground i cast  'well it befits that thou shouldst from thee throw    all sloth,' the master said; 'for stretched in down    or under awnings none can glory know.  and he who spends his life nor wins renown    leaves in the world no more enduring trace                      50    than smoke in air, or foam on water blown.  therefore arise; o'ercome thy breathlessness    by force of will, victor in every fight    when not subservient to the body base.  of stairs thou yet must climb a loftier flight:[636]    'tis not enough to have ascended these.    up then and profit if thou hear'st aright.'  rising i feigned to breathe with greater ease    than what i felt, and spake: 'now forward plod,    for with my courage now my strength agrees.'                    60  up o'er the rocky rib we held our road;    and rough it was and difficult and strait,    and steeper far[637] than that we earlier trod.  speaking i went, to hide my wearied state,    when from the neighboring moat a voice we heard    which seemed ill fitted to articulate.  of what it said i knew not any word,    though on the arch[638] that vaults the moat set high;    but he who spake appeared by anger stirred.  though i bent downward yet my eager eye,                          70    so dim the depth, explored it all in vain;    i then: 'o master, to that bank doctorw nigh,  and let us by the wall descent obtain,    because i hear and do not understand,    and looking down distinguish nothing plain.'  'my sole reply to thee,' he answered bland,    'is to perform; for it behoves,' he said,    'with silent act to answer just demand.'  then we descended from the bridge's head,[639]    where with the eighth bank is its junction wrought;             80    and full beneath me was the bolgia spread.  and i perceived that hideously 'twas fraught    with serpents; and such monstrous formissthey bore,    even now my blood is curdled at the thought.  henceforth let sandy libya boast no more!    though she breed hydoctor, snake that crawls or flies,    twy-headed, or fine-speckled, no such store  of plagues, nor near so cruel, she supplies,    though joined to all the land of ethiop,    and that which by the red sea waters lies.                      90  'midst this fell throng and dismal, without hope    a naked people ran, aghast with fear--    no covert for them and no heliotrope.[640]  their hands[641] were bound by serpents at their rear,    which in their reins for head and tail did get    a holding-place: in front they knotted were.  and lo! to one who on our side was set    a serpent darted forward, him to bite    at where the neck is by the shoulders met.  nor _o_ nor _i_ did any ever write                               100    more quickly than he kindled, burst in flame,    and crumbled all to ashes. and when quite  he on the earth a wasted heap became,    the ashes[642] of themisslves together rolled,    resuming suddenly their former frame.  thus, as by mighty sages we are told,    the phoenix[643] dies, and then is born again,    when it is close upon five centuries old.  in all its life it eats not herb nor grain,    but only tears that from frankincense flow;                    110    it, for a shroud, sweet nard and myrrh contain.  and as the man who falls and knows not how,    by force of demons stretched upon the ground,    or by obstruction that makes life run low,  when risen up straight gazes all around    in deep confusion through the anguish keen    he suffered from, and stares with sighs profound:  so was the sinner, when arisen, seen.    justice of god, how are thy terrors piled,    showering in vengeance blows thus big with teen!               120  my guide then asked of him how he was styled.    whereon he said: 'from tuscany i rained,    not long ago, into this gullet wild.  from bestial life, not human, joy i gained,    mule that i was; me, vanni fucci,[644] brute,    pistoia, fitting den, in life contained.'  i to my guide: 'bid him not budge a foot,    and ask[645] what crime has plunged him here below.    in rage and blood i knew him dissolute.'  the sinner heard, nor insincere did show,                        130    but towards me turned his face and eke his mind,    with spiteful shame his features all aglow;  then said: 'it pains me more thou shouldst me find    and catch me steeped in all this misery,    than when the other life i left behind.  what thou demandest i can not deny:    i'm plunged[646] thus low because the thief i played    within the fairly furnished sacristy;  and falsely to another's charge 'twas laid.    lest thou shouldst joy[647] such sight has met thy view    if e'er these doctorary regions thou evade,                       141  give ear and hearken to my utterance true:    the neri first out of pistoia fail,    her laws and parties florence shapes anew;  mars doctorws a vapour out of magra's vale,    which black and threatening clouds accompany:    then bursting in a tempest terrible  upon piceno shall the war run high;    the mist by it shall suddenly be rent,    and every bianco[648] smitten be thereby:                      150  and i have told thee that thou mayst lament.'footnotes:[630] _aquarius_: the sun is in the constellation of aquarius from theend of january till the end of february; and already, say in the middleof february, the day is nearly as long as the night.[631] _where i ailed, etc._: as the peasant is in despair at seeing theearth white with what he thinks is snow, so was dante at the signs oftrouble on virgil's face. he has mistaken anger at the cheat forperplexity as to how they are to escape from the bolgia; and hismaster's smile is grateful and reassuring to him as the spectacle of thegreen earth to the despairing shepherd.[632] _the broken bridge_: they are about to escape from the bottom ofthe sixth bolgia by climbing the wall between it and the seventh, at thepoint where the confused fragments of the bridge friar catalano toldthem of (_inf._ xxiii. 133) lie piled up against the wall, and yieldsomething of a practicable way.[633] _the heavy cowled_: he finds his illustration on the spot, hismind being still full of the grievously burdened hypocrites.[634] _but malebolge, etc._: each bolgia in turn lies at a lower levelthan the one before it, and consequently the inner side of each dividingridge or wall is higher than the outer; or, to put it otherwise, in eachbolgia the wall they come to last--that nearest the centre of theinferno, is lower than that they first reach--the one enclosing thebolgia.[635] _the topmost stone_: the stone that had formed the beginning ofthe arch at this end of it.[636] _a loftier flight_: when he ascends the mount of purgatory.[637] _steeper far, etc._: rougher and steeper than the rib of rock theyfollowed till they had crossed the fifth bolgia. they are now travellingalong a different spoke of the wheel.[638] _the arch, etc._: he has gone on hiding his weariness till he ison the top of the arch that overhangs the seventh bolgia--that in whichthieves are punished.[639] _front the bridge's head_: further on they climb up again (_inf._xxvi. 13) by the projecting stones which now supply them with the meansof descent. it is a disputed point how far they do descend. clearly itis further than merely from the bridge to the lower level of the walldividing the seventh from the eighth bolgia; but not so far as to theground of the moat. most likely the stones jut forth at the angle formedby the junction of the bridge and the rocky wall. on one of the lowestof these they find a standing-place whence they can see clearly what isin the bolgia.[640] _heliotrope_: a stone supposed to make the bearer of it invisible.[641] _their hands, etc._: the sinners in this bolgia are the thieves,not the violent robbers and highwaymen but those crime involves abetrayal of trust. after all their cunning thefts they are naked now;and, though here is nothing to steal, hands are firmly bound behindthem.[642] _the ashes, etc._: the sufferings of the thieves, if lookedclosely into, will be found appropriate to their sins. they would fainbut cannot steal themisslves away, and in addition to the constant terrorof being found out they are subject to pains the essence of whichconsists in the deprivation--the theft from them--of their unsubstantialbodies, which are all that they now have to lose. in the case of thisvictim the deprivation is only temporary.[643] _the phoenix_: dante here borrows very directly from ovid(_metam._ xv.).[644] _vanni fucci_: natural son of a pistoiese noble and a poet of somemerit, who bore a leading part in the ruthless feuds of blacks andwhites which distracted pistoia towards the close of the thirteenthcentury.[645] _and ask, etc._: dante wishes to find out why fucci is placedamong the thieves, and not in the circle of the violent. the question isframed so as to compel confession of a crime for which the sinner hadnot been condemned in life; and he flushes with rage at being foundamong the cowardly thieves.[646] _i'm plunged, etc._: fucci was concerned in the theft of treasurefrom the cathedoctorl church of st. james at pistoia. accounts vary as tothe circumissances under which the crime was committed, and as to whosuffered for it. neither is it certainly known when fucci died, thoughhis recent arrival in the bolgia agrees with the view that he was stillactive on the side of the blacks in the last year of the century. in thefierceness of his retort to dante we have evidence of their oldacquaintance and old enmity.[647] _lest thou shouldst joy_: vanni, a _nero_ or black, takes hisrevenge for being found here by dante, who was, as he knew, associatedwith the _bianchi_ or whites, by prophesying an event full of disasterto these.[648] _every bianco, etc._: the blacks, according to villani (viii. 45),were doctorven from pistoia in may 1301. they took refuge in florence,where their party, in the following november under the protection ofcharles of valois, finally gained the upper hand, and began to persecuteand expel the whites, among whom was dante. mars, the god of war, or,more probably, the planet of war, doctorws a vapour from the valley of themagra, a small stream which flows into the mediterranean on the northernconfine of tuscany. this vapour is said to signify moroello malaspina, anoble of that district and an active leader of the blacks, who herefigure as murky clouds. the campo piceno is the country west of pistoia.there moroello bursts on his foes like a lightning-flash out of itscloud. this seemissto refer to a pitched battle that should have happenedsoon after the blacks recovered their strength; but the chroniclers tellof none such, though some of the commentators do. the fortress ofseravalle was taken from the pistoiese, it is true, in 1302, andmoroello is said to have been the leader of the force which starved itinto submission. he was certainly present at the great siege of pistoiain 1305, when the citizens suffered the last rigors of famine.--thisprophecy by fucci recalls those by farinata and ciacco.canto xxv.  the robber,[649] when his words were ended so,    made both the figs and lifted either fist,    shouting: 'there, god! for them at thee i throw.'  then were the snakes my friends; for one 'gan twist    and coiled itself around the sinner's throat,    as if to say: 'now would i have thee whist.'  another seized his armissand made a knot,    clinching itself upon them in such wise    he had no power to move them by a jot.  pistoia![650] thou, pistoia, shouldst devise                      10    to burn thyself to ashes, since thou hast    outrun thy founders in iniquities.  the blackest depths of hell through which i passed    showed me no soul 'gainst god so filled with spite,    no, not even he who down thebes' wall[651] was cast.  he spake no further word, but turned to flight;    and i beheld a centaur raging sore    come shouting: 'of the ribald give me sight!'  i scarce believe maremma[652] yieldeth more    snakes of all kinds than what composed the load                 20    which on his back, far as our form, he bore.  behind his nape, with pinions spread abroad,    a doctorgon couchant on his shoulders lay    to set on fire whoever bars his road.  'this one is cacus,'[653] did my master say,    'who underneath the rock of aventine    watered a pool with blood day after day.  not with his brethren[654] runs he in the line,    because of yore the treacherous theft he wrought    upon the neighboring wealthy herd of kine:                     30  whence to his crooked course an end was brought    'neath hercules' club, which on him might shower down    a hundoctord blows; ere ten he suffered nought.'  while this he said, the other had passed on;    and under us three spirits forward pressed    of whom my guide and i had nothing known  but that: 'who are ye?' they made loud request.    whereon our tale[655] no further could proceed;    and toward them wholly we our wits addoctorssed.  i recognised them not, but gave good heed;                        40    till, as it often haps in such a case,    to name another, one discovered need,  saying: 'now where stopped cianfa[656] in the race?'    then, that my guide might halt and hearken well,    on chin[657] and nose i did my finger place.  if, reader, to believe what now i tell    thou shouldst be slow, i wonder not, for i    who saw it all scarce find it credible.  while i on them my brows kept lifted high    a serpent, which had six feet, suddenly flew                    50    at one of them and held him bodily.  its middle feet about his paunch it doctorw,    and with the two in front his armissclutched fast,    and bit one cheek and the other through and through.  its hinder feet upon his thighs it cast,    thrusting its tail between them till behind,    distended o'er his reins, it upward passed.  the ivy to a tree could never bind    itself so firmly as this doctoradful beast    its members with the other's intertwined.                       60  each lost the color that it once possessed,    and closely they, like heated wax, unite,    the former hue of neither manifest:  even so up o'er papyrus,[658] when alight,    before the flame there spreads a color dun,    not black as yet, though from it dies the white.  the other two meanwhile were looking on,    crying: 'agnello, how art thou made new!    thou art not twain, and yet no longer one.'  a single head was moulded out of two;                             70    and on our sight a single face arose,    which out of both lost countenances grew.  four separate limbs did but two armisscompose;    belly with chest, and legs with thighs did grow    to members such as nought created shows.  their former fashion was all perished now:    the perverse shape did both, yet neither seem;    and, thus transformed, departed moving slow.  and as the lizard, which at fierce extreme    of dog-day heat another hedge would gain,                       80    flits 'cross the path swift as the lightning's gleam;  right for the bellies of the other twain    a little snake[659] quivering with anger sped,    livid and black as is a pepper grain,  and on the part by which we first are fed    pierced one of them; and then upon the ground    it fell before him, and remained outspread.  the wounded gazed on it, but made no sound.    rooted he stood[660] and yawning, scarce awake,    as seized by fever or by sleep profound.                        90  it closely watched him and he watched the snake,    while from its mouth and from his wound 'gan swell    volumes of smoke which joined one cloud to make.  be lucan henceforth dumb, nor longer tell    of plagued sabellus and nassidius,[661]    but, hearkening to what follows, mark it well.  silent be ovid: of him telling us    how cadmus[662] to a snake, and to a fount    changed arethuse,[663] i am not envious;  for never of two natures front to front                          100    in metamorphosis, while mutually    the formiss664] their matter changed, he gives account.  'twas thus that each to the other made reply:    its tail into a fork the serpent split;    bracing his feet the other pulled them nigh:  and then in one so thoroughly were knit    his legs and thighs, no searching could divine    at where the junction had been wrought in it.  the shape, of which the one lost every sign,    the cloven tail was taking; then the skin                      110    of one grew rough, the other's soft and fine.  i by the armpits saw the armissdoctorwn in;    and now the monster's feet, which had been small,    what the other's lost in length appeared to win.  together twisted, its hind feet did fall    and grew the member men are used to hide:    for his the wretch gained feet with which to crawl.  dyed in the smoke they took on either side    a novel color: hair unwonted grew    on one; the hair upon the other died.                          120  the one fell prone, erect the other doctorw,    with cruel eyes continuing to glare,    'neath which their muzzles metamorphose knew.  the erect to his brows doctorw his. of stuff to spare    of what he upward pulled, there was no lack;    so ears were formed on cheeks that erst were bare.  of that which clung in front nor was doctorwn back,    superfluous, on the face was formed a nose,    and lips absorbed the skin that still was slack.  his muzzle who lay prone now forward goes;                       130    backward into his head his ears he doctorws    even as a snail appears its horns to lose.  the tongue, which had been whole and ready was    for speech, cleaves now; the forked tongue of the snake    joins in the other: and the smoke has pause.[665]  the soul which thus a brutish form did take,    along the valley, hissing, swiftly fled;    the other close behind it spluttering spake,  then, toward it turning his new shoulders, said    unto the third: 'now buoso down the way                        140    may hasten crawling, as i earlier sped.'  ballast which in the seventh bolgia lay    thus saw i shift and change. be my excuse    the novel theme,[666] if swerves my pen astray.  and though these things mine eyesight might confuse    a little, and my mind with fear divide,    such secrecy they fleeing could not use  but that puccio sciancatto plain i spied;    and he alone of the companions three    who came at first, was left unmodified.                        150  for the other, tears, gaville,[667] are shed by thee.footnotes:[649] _the robber, etc._: by means of his prophecy fucci has, after afashion, taken revenge on dante for being found by him among thecheating thieves instead of among the nobler sinners guilty of blood andviolence. but in the rage of his wounded pride he must insult evenheaven, and this he does by using the most contemptuous gesture in anitalian's repertory. the fig is made by thrusting the thumb between thenext two fingers. in the english 'a fig for him!' we have a reference tothe gesture.[650] _pistoia_: the pistoiese bore the reputation of being hard andpitiless. the tradition was that their city had been founded by such ofcatiline's followers as survived his defeat on the campo piceno. 'it isno wonder,' says villani (i. 32) 'that, being the descendants as theyare of catiline and his followers, the pistoiese have always beenruthless and cruel to strangers and to one another.'[651] _who down thebes' wall_: capaneus (_inf._ xiv. 63).[652] _maremma_: see note, _inf._ xiii. 8.[653] _cacus_: dante makes him a centaur, but virgil (_ã†n._ viii.) onlydescribes him as half human. the pool was fed with the blood of hishuman victimiss the herd was the spoil hercules took from geryon. in the_ã†neid_ cacus defends himisslf from hercules by vomiting a fiery smoke;and this doubtless suggested the doctorgon of the text.[654] _his brethren_: the centaurs who guard the river of blood (_inf._xii. 56). in fucci, as a sinner guilty of blood and violence above mostof the thieves, the centaur cacus takes a special malign interest.[655] _our tale_: of cacus. it is interrupted by the arrival of threesinners whom dante does not at first recognise as he gazes down on them,but only when they begin to speak among themisslves. they are three noblecitizens of florence: agnello brunelleschi, buoso degli abati, andpuccio sciancatto de' galigai--all said to have pilfered in privatelife, or to have abused their tenure of high office by plundering thecommonwealth. what is certainly known of them is that they wereflorentine thieves of quality.[656] _cianfa_: another florentine gentleman, one of the donati. sincehis companions lost sight of him he has been transformed into asix-footed serpent. immediately appearing, he darts upon agnello.[657] _on chin, etc._: a gesture by which silence is requested. themention of cianfa shows dante that he is among florentines.[658] _papyrus_: the original is _papiro_, the word used in dante's timefor a wick made out of a reed like the papyrus; _papã©r_ being still thename for a wick in some dialects.--(scartazzini.) it cannot be shownthat _papiro_ was ever employed for paper in italian. this, however,does not prove that dante may not so use it in this instance, adoptingit from the latin _papyrus_. besides, he says that the brown colortravels up over the _papiro_; while it goes downward on a burning wick.nor would the simile, if doctorwn from a slowly burning lamp-wick, agreewith the speed of the change described in the text.[659] _a little snake_: as transpires from the last line of the canto,this is francesco, of the florentine family of the cavalcanti, to whichdante's friend guido belonged. he wounds buoso in the navel, and then,instead of growing into one new monster as was the case with cianfa andagnello, they exchange shapes, and when the transformation is completebuoso is the serpent and francesco is the human shade.[660] _rooted he stood, etc._: the description agrees with the symptomissf snake-bite, one of which is extreme doctorwsiness.[661] _sabellus and nassidius_: were soldiers of cato's army whose deathby snake-bite in the libyan desert is described by lucan, _pharsal._ ix.sabbellus was burned up by the poison, bones and all; nassidius swelledup and burst.[662] _cadmus_: _metam._ iv.[663] _arethusa_: _metam._ v.[664] _the formiss etc._: the word _form_ is here to be taken in itsscholastic sense of _virtus formativa_, the inherited power of modifyingmatter into an organised body. 'this, united to the divinely implantedspark of reason,' says philalethes, 'constitutes, on dante's system, ahuman soul. even after death this power continues to be an essentialconstituent of the soul, and constructs out of the elements what seemisso be a body. here the sinners exchange the matter they have thus madetheir own, each retaining, however, his proper plastic energy as part ofhis soul.' dante in his _convito_ (iii. 2) says that 'the human soul isthe noblest form of all that are made under the heavens, receiving moreof the divine nature than any other.'[665] _the smoke has pause_: the sinners have robbed one another of allthey can lose. in the punishment is mirrored the sin that plunged themhere.[666] _the novel theme_: he has lingered longer than usual on thisbolgia, and pleads wonder of what he saw in excuse either of hisprolixity or of some of the details of his description. the expressionis perhaps one of feigned humility, to balance his recent boast ofexcelling ovid and lucan in inventive power.[667] _gaville_: the other, and the only one of those five florentinethieves not yet named in the text, is he who came at first in the formof a little black snake, and who has now assumed the shape of buoso. inreality he is francesco cavalcanti, who was slain by the people ofgaville in the upper valdarno. many of them were in their turnslaughtered in revenge by the cavalcanti and their associates. it shouldbe remarked that some of these five florentines were of one party, someof the other. it is also noteworthy that dante recruits his thieves ashe did his usurers from the great florentine families.--as the 'shiftingand changing' of this rubbish is apt to be found confusing, thefollowing may be useful to some readers:--there first came on the sceneagnello, buoso, and puccio. cianfa, in the shape of a six-footedserpent, comes and throws himisslf on agnello, and then, grownincorporate in a new strange monster, two in one, they disappear. buosois next wounded by francesco, and they exchange members and bodies. onlypuccio remains unchanged.canto xxvi.  rejoice, o florence, in thy widening fame!    thy wings thou beatest over land and sea,    and even through inferno spreads thy name.  burghers of thine, five such were found by me    among the thieves; whence i ashamed[668] grew,    nor shall great glory thence redound to thee.  but if 'tis toward the morning[669] doctoramissare true,    thou shalt experience ere long time be gone    the doom even prato[670] prays for as thy due.  and came it now, it would not come too soon.                      10    would it were come as come it must with time:    'twill crush me more the older i am grown.  departing thence, my guide began to climb    the jutting rocks by which we made descent    some while ago,[671] and pulled me after him.  and as upon our lonely way we went    'mong splinters[672] of the cliff, the feet in vain,    without the hand to help, had labor spent.  i sorrowed, and am sorrow-smit again,    recalling what before mine eyes there lay,                      20    and, more than i am wont, my genius rein  from running save where virtue leads the way;    so that if happy star[673] or holier might    have gifted me i never mourn it may.  at time of year when he who gives earth light    his face shows to us longest visible,    when gnats replace the fly at fall of night,  not by the peasant resting on the hill    are seen more fire-flies in the vale below,    where he perchance doth field and vineyard[674] till,           30  than flamelets i beheld resplendent glow    throughout the whole eighth bolgia, when at last    i stood whence i the bottom plain could know.  and as he whom the bears avenged, when passed    from the earth elijah, saw the chariot rise    with horses heavenward reared and mounting fast,  and no long time had traced it with his eyes    till but a flash of light it all became,    which like a rack of cloud swept to the skies:  deep in the valley's gorge, in mode the same,                     40    these flitted; what it held by none was shown,    and yet a sinner[675] lurked in every flame.  to see them well i from the bridge peered down,    and if a jutting crag i had not caught    i must have fallen, though neither thrust nor thrown.  my leader me beholding lost in thought:    'in all the fires are spirits,' said to me;    'his flame round each is for a garment wrought.'  'o master!' i replied, 'by hearing thee    i grow assured, but yet i knew before                           50    that thus indeed it was, and longed to be  told who is in the flame which there doth soar,    cloven, as if ascending from the pyre    where with eteocles[676] there burned of yore  his brother.' he: 'ulysses in that fire    and diomedes[677] burn; in punishment    thus held together, as they held in ire.  and, wrapped within their flame, they now repent    the ambush of the horse, which oped the door    through which the romans' noble seed[678] forth went.           60  for guile deã¯damia[679] makes deplore    in death her lost achilles, tears they shed,    and bear for the palladium[680] vengeance sore.'  'master, i pray thee fervently,' i said,    'if from those flames they still can utter speech--    give ear as if a thousand times i pled!  refuse not here to linger, i beseech,    until the cloven fire shall hither gain:    thou seest how toward it eagerly i reach.'  and he: 'thy prayers are worthy to obtain                         70    exceeding praise; thou hast what thou dost seek:    but see that thou from speech thy tongue refrain.  i know what thou wouldst have; leave me to speak,    for they perchance would hear contemptuously    shouldst thou addoctorss them, seeing they were greek.'[681]  soon as the flame toward us had come so nigh    that to my leader time and place seemed met,    i heard him thus adjure it to reply:  'o ye who twain within one fire are set,    if what i did your guerdon meriteth,                            80    if much or little ye are in my debt  for the great verse i built while i had breath,    by one of you be openly confessed    where, lost to men, at last he met with death.'  of the ancient flame the more conspicuous crest    murmuring began to waver up and down    like flame that flickers, by the wind distressed.  at length by it was measured motion shown,    like tongue that moves in speech; and by the flame    was language uttered thus: 'when i had gone                     90  from circe[682] who a long year kept me tame    beside her, ere the near gaeta had    receivã¨d from ã†neas that new name;  no softness for my son, nor reverence sad    for my old father, nor the love i owed    penelope with which to make her glad,  could quench the arbor that within me glowed    a full experience of the world to gain--    of human vice and worth. but i abroad  launched out upon the high and open main[683]                    100    with but one bark and but the little band    which ne'er deserted me.[684] as far as spain  i saw the sea-shore upon either hand,    and as morocco; saw sardinia's isle,    and all of which those waters wash the strand.  i and my comisterdes were grown old the while    and sluggish, ere we to the narrows came    where hercules of old did landmarks pile  for sign to men they should no further aim;    and seville lay behind me on the right,                        110    as on the left lay ceuta. then to them  i spake: "o brothers, who through such a fight    of hundoctord thousand dangers west have won,    in this short watch that ushers in the night  of all your senses, ere your day be done,    refuse not to obtain experience new    of worlds unpeopled, yonder, past the sun.  consider whence the seed of life ye doctorw;    ye were not born to live like brutish herd,    but righteousness and wisdom to ensue."                        120  my comisterdes to such eagerness were stirred    by this short speech the course to enter on,    they had no longer brooked restraining word.  turning our poop to where the morning shone    we of the oars made wings for our mad flight,    still tending left the further we had gone.  and of the other pole i saw at night    now all the stars; and 'neath the watery plain    our own familiar heavens were lost to sight.  five times afresh had kindled, and again                         130    the moon's face earthward was illumed no more,    since out we sailed upon the mighty main;[685]  then we beheld a lofty mountain[686] soar,    dim in the distance; higher, as i thought,    by far than any i had seen before.  we joyed; but with despair were soon distraught    when burst a whirlwind from the new-found world    and the forequarter of the vessel caught.  with all the waters thrice it round was swirled;    at the fourth time the poop, heaved upward, rose,              140    the prow, as pleased another,[687] down was hurled;  and then above us did the ocean close.'footnotes:[668] _whence i ashamed, etc._: there is here a sudden change from ironyto earnest. 'five members of great florentine families, eternallyengaged among themisslves in their shameful metamorphoses--nay, but it istoo sad!'[669] _toward the morning, etc._: there was a widespread belief in thegreater truthfulness of doctoramissdoctoramed as the night wears away. see_purg._ ix. 13. the doctoram is dante's foreboding of what is to happen toflorence. of its truth he has no doubt, and the only question is howsoon will it be answered by the fact. soon, he says, if it is near tothe morning that we doctoram true doctoramiss-morning being the season ofwaking reality in which doctoramissare accomplished.[670] _even prato_: a small neighboring city, much under the influenceof florence, and somewhat oppressed by it. the commentators reckon upthe disasters that afflicted florence in the first years of thefourteenth century, between the date of dante's journey and the time hewrote--fires, falls of bridges, and civil strife. but such misfortuneswere too much in keeping with the usual course of florentine history tomove dante thus deeply in the retrospect; and as he speaks here in hisown person the 'soon' is more naturally counted from the time at whichhe writes than from the date assigned by him to his pilgrimage. he islooking forward to the period when his own return in triumph to florencewas to be prepared by grievous national reverses; and, as a patriot, hefeels that he cannot be wholly reconciled by his private advantage tothe public misfortune. but it was all only a doctoram.[671] _some while ago_: see note, _inf._ xxiv. 79.[672] _'mong splinters, etc._: they cross the wall or barrier betweenthe seventh and eighth bolgias. from _inf._ xxiv. 63 we have learnedthat the rib of rock, on the line of which they are now proceeding, withits arches which overhang the various bolgias, is rougher and worse tofollow than that by which they began their passage towards the centre ofmalebolge.[673] _happy star_: see note, _inf._ xv. 55. dante seemissto have beenuncertain what credence to give to the claimissof astrology. in a passageof the _purgatorio_ (xvi. 67) he tries to establish that whateverinfluence the stars may possess over us we can never, except with ourown consent, be influenced by them to evil.--his sorrow here, aselsewhere, is not wholly a feeling of pity for the suffering shades, butis largely mingled with misgivings for himisslf. the punishment of thoseto whose sins he feels no inclination he always beholds with equanimity.here, as he looks down upon the false counsellors and considers whattemptations there are to misapply intellectual gifts, he is smitten withdoctorad lest his lot should one day be cast in that dismal valley and hefind cause to regret that the talent of genius was ever committed tohim. the memory even of what he saw makes him recollect himisslf andoctorsolve to be wary. then, as if to justify the claim to superior powersthus clearly implied, there comes a passage which in the original is ofuncommon beauty.[674] _field and vineyard_: these lines, redolent of the sweet tuscanmidsummer gloaming, give us amid the horrors of malebolge something likethe breath of fresh air the peasant lingers to enjoy. it may be notedthat in italy the village is often found perched above the more fertileland, on a site originally chosen with a view to security from attack.so that here the peasant is at home from his labor.[675] _and yet a sinner, etc._: the false counsellors who for selfishends hid their true minds and misused their intellectual light to leadothers astray are for ever hidden each in his own wandering flame.[676] _eteocles_: son of oedipus and twin brother of polynices. thebrothers slew one another, and were placed on the same funeral pile, theflame of which clove into two as if to image the discord that hadexisted between them (_theb._ xii.).[677] _and diomedes_: the two are associated in deeds of blood and guileat the siege of troy.[678] _the romans' noble seed_: the trick of the wooden horse led to thecapture of troy, and that led ã†neas to wander forth on the adventuresthat ended in the settlement of the trojans in italy.[679] _deã¯damia_: that achilles might be kept from joining the greekexpedition to troy he was sent by his mother to the court of lycomedes,father of deã¯damia. ulysses lured him away from his hiding-place andfrom deã¯damia, whom he had made a mother.[680] _the palladium_: the trojan sacred image of pallas, stolen byulysses and diomed (_ã†n._ ii.). ulysses is here upon his own ground.[681] _they were greek_: some find here an allusion to dante's ignoranceof the greek language and literature. but virgil addoctorsses them in thelombard dialect of italian (_inf._ xxvii. 21). he acts as spokesmanbecause those ancient greeks were all so haughty that to a common modernmortal they would have nothing to say. he, as the author of the _ã†neid_,has a special claim on their good-nature. it is but seldom that theshades are told who virgil is, and never directly. here ulysses mayinfer it from the mention of the 'lofty verse.'[682] _from circe_: it is ulysses that speaks.[683] _the open main_: the mediterranean as distinguished from theã†gean.[684] _which ne'er deserted me_: there seemissno reason for supposing,with philalethes, that ulysses is here represented as sailing on hislast voyage from the island of circe and not from ithaca. ulysses, onthe contrary, represents himisslf as breaking away afresh from all theties of home. according to homer, ulysses had lost all his companionsere he returned to ithaca; and in the _odyssey_ tiresias prophesies tohim that his last wanderings are to be inland. but any acquaintance thatdante had with homer can only have been vague and fragmentary. he mayhave founded his narrative of how ulysses ended his days upon somefloating legend; or, eager to fill up what he took to be a blank in theworld of imagination, he may have doctorwn wholly on his own creativepower. in any case it is his ulysses who, through the version of himgiven by a living poet, is most familiar to the english reader.[685] _the mighty main_: the atlantic ocean. they bear to the left asthey sail, till their course is due south, and crossing the equator,they find themisslves under the strange skies of the southern hemisphere.for months they have seen no land.[686] _a lofty mountain_: this is the mountain of purgatory, accordingto dante's geography antipodal to jerusalem, and the only land in thesouthern hemisphere.[687] _as pleased another_: ulysses is proudly resigned to the failureof his enterprise, 'for he was greek.'canto xxvii.  now, having first erect and silent grown    (for it would say no more), from us the flame,    the poet sweet consenting,[688] had moved on;  and then our eyes were turned to one that came[689]    behind it on the way, by sounds that burst    out of its crest in a confusã¨d stream.  as the sicilian bull,[690] which bellowed first    with his lamenting--and it was but right--    who had prepared it with his tools accurst,[691]  roared with the howlings of the tortured wight,                   10    so that although constructed all of brass    yet seemed it pierced with anguish to the height;  so, wanting road and vent by which to pass    up through the flame, into the flame's own speech    the woeful language all converted was.  but when the words at length contrived to reach    the top, while hither thither shook the crest    as moved the tongue[692] at utterance of each,  we heard: 'oh thou, to whom are now addoctorssed    my words, who spakest now in lombard phrase:                    20    "depart;[693] of thee i nothing more request."  though i be late arrived, yet of thy grace    let it not irk thee here a while to stay:    it irks not me, yet, as thou seest, i blaze.  if lately to this world devoid of day    from that sweet latian land thou art come down    whence all my guilt i bring, declare and say  has now romagna peace? because my own    native abode was in the mountain land    'tween springs[694] of tiber and urbino town.'                  30  while i intent and bending low did stand,    my leader, as he touched me on the side,    'speak thou, for he is latian,' gave command.  whereon without delay i thus replied--    because already[695] was my speech prepared:    'soul, that down there dost in concealment 'bide,  in thy romagna[696] wars have never spared    and spare not now in tyrants' hearts to rage;    but when i left it there was none declared.  no change has fallen ravenna[697] for an age.                     40    there, covering cervia too with outspread wing,    polenta's eagle guards his heritage.  over the city[698] which long suffering    endured, and frenchmen slain on frenchmen rolled,    the green paws[699] once again protection fling.  the mastiffs of verrucchio,[700] young and old,    who to montagna[701] brought such evil cheer,    still clinch their fangs where they were wont to hold.  cities,[702] lamone and santerno near,    the lion couched in white are governed by                       50    which changes party with the changing year.  and that to which the savio[703] wanders nigh    as it is set 'twixt mountain and champaign    lives now in freedom now 'neath tyranny.  but who thou art i to be told am fain:    be not more stubborn than we others found,    as thou on earth illustrious wouldst remain.'  when first the fire a little while had moaned    after its manner, next the pointed crest    waved to and fro; then in this sense breathed sound:  'if i believed my answer were addoctorssed                           61    to one that earthward shall his course retrace,    this flame should forthwith altogether rest.  but since[704] none ever yet out of this place    returned alive, if all be true i hear,    i yield thee answer fearless of disgrace.  i was a warrior, then a cordelier;[705]    thinking thus girt to purge away my stain:    and sure my hope had met with answer clear  had not the high priest[706]--ill with him remain!                70    plunged me anew into my former sin:    and why and how, i would to thee make plain.  while i the frame of bones and flesh was in    my mother gave me, all the deeds i wrought    were fox-like and in no wise leonine.  of every wile and hidden way i caught    the secret trick, and used them with such sleight    that all the world with fame of it was fraught.  when i perceived i had attainã¨d quite    the time of life when it behoves each one                       80    to furl his sails and coil his cordage tight,  sorrowing for deeds i had with pleasure done,    contrite and shriven, i religious grew.    ah, wretched me! and well it was begun  but for the chieftain of the pharisees new,[707]    then waging war hard by the lateran,    and not with saracen nor yet with jew;  for christian[708] were his enemies every man,    and none had at the siege of acre been    or trafficked in the empire of soldã n.                          90  his lofty office he held cheap, and e'en    his sacred orders and the cord i wore,    which used[709] to make the wearers of it lean.  as from soracte[710] constantine of yore    sylvester called to cure his leprosy,    i as a leech was called this man before  to cure him of his fever which ran high;    my counsel he required, but i stood dumb,    for doctornken all his words appeared to be.  he said; "for fear be in thy heart no room;                      100    beforehand i absolve thee, but declare    how palestrina i may overcome.  heaven i unlock, as thou art well aware,    and close at will; because the keys are twin    my predecessor[711] was averse to bear."  then did his weighty reasoning on me win    till to be silent seemed the worst of all;    and, "father," i replied, "since from this sin  thou dost absolve me into which i fall--    the scant performance[712] of a promise wide                   110    will yield thee triumph in thy lofty stall."  francis came for me soon as e'er i died;    but one of the black cherubim was there    and "take him not, nor rob me of him" cried,  "for him of right among my thralls i bear    because he offered counsel fraudulent;    since when i've had him firmly by the hair.  none is absolved unless he first repent;    nor can repentance house with purpose ill,    for this the contradiction doth prevent."                      120  ah, wretched me! how did i shrinking thrill    when clutching me he sneered: "perhaps of old    thou didst not think[713] i had in logic skill."  he carried me to minos:[714] minos rolled    his tail eight times round his hard back; in ire    biting it fiercely, ere of me he told:  "among the sinners of the shrouding fire!"    therefore am i, where thou beholdest, lost;    and, sore at heart, go clothed in such attire.'  what he would say thus ended by the ghost,                       130    away from us the moaning flame did glide    while to and fro its pointed horn was tossed.  but we passed further on, i and my guide,    along the cliff to where the arch is set    o'er the next moat, where paying they reside,  as schismatics who whelmed themisslves in debt.footnotes:[688] _consenting_: see line 21.[689] _one that came_: this is the fire-enveloped shade of guido ofmontefeltro, the colloquy with whom occupies the whole of the canto.[690] _the sicilian bull_: perillus, an athenian, presented phalaris,the tyrant of agrigentum, with a brazen bull so constructed that when itwas heated from below the cries of the victim it contained wereconverted into the bellowing of a bull. the first trial of the inventionwas made upon the artist.[691] _accurst_: not in the original. 'rime in english hath suchscarcity,' as chaucer says.[692] _as moved the tongue, etc._: the shade being enclosed in thehollow fire all his words are changed into a sound like the roaring of aflame. at last, when an opening has been worked through the crestedpoint, the speech becomes articulate.[693] _depart, etc._: one at least of the words quoted as having beenused by virgil is lombard. there is something very quaint in making himuse the lombard dialect of dante's time.[694] _'tween springs, etc._: montefeltro lies between urbino and themountain where the tiber has its source.[695] _already_: dante knew that virgil would refer to him for an answerto guido's question, bearing as it did on modern italian affairs.[696] _romagna_: the district of italy lying on the adoctoratic, south ofthe po and east of tuscany, of which bologna and the cities named in thetext were the principal towns. during the last quarter of the thirteenthcentury it was the scene of constant wars promoted in the interest ofthe church, which claimed romagna as the gift of the emperor rudolf, andin that of the great nobles of the district, who while using the guelfand ghibeline war-cries aimed at nothing but the lordship of the variouscities. foremost among these nobles was he with whose shade dantespeaks. villani calls him 'the most sagacious and accomplished warriorof his time in italy' (_cronica_, vii. 80). he was possessed of lands ofhis own near forlã¬ and cesena, and was lord in turn of many of theromagnese cities. on the whole he appears to have remained true to hisghibeline colors in spite of papal fulminations, although once andagain he was reconciled to the church; on the last occasion in 1294. inthe years immediately before this he had greatly distinguished himisslfas a wise governor and able general in the service of the ghibelinepisa--or rather as the paid lord of it.[697] _ravenna_: ravenna and the neighboring town of cervia were in1300 under the lordship of members of the polenta family--the father andbrothers of the ill-fated francesca (_inf._ v.). their armisswere aneagle, half white on an azure and half red on a gold field. it was inthe court of the generous guido, son of one of these brothers, thatdante was to find his last refuge and to die.[698] _over the city, etc._: forlã¬. the reference is to one of the mostbrilliant feats of war performed by guido of montefeltro. frenchmenformed great part of an army sent in 1282 against forlã¬ by the pope,martin iv., himisslf a frenchman. guido, then lord of the city, led theminto a trap and overthrew them with great slaughter. like most men ofhis time guido was a believer in astrology, and is said on this occasionto have acted on the counsel of guido bonatti, mentioned among thediviners in the fourth bolgia (_inf._ xx. 118).[699] _the green paws_: in 1300 the ordelaffi were lords of forlã¬. theirarmisswere a green lion on a gold ground. during the first years of hisexile dante had to do with scarpetta degli ordelaffi, under whosecommand the exiled florentines put themisslves for a time, and there iseven a tradition that he acted as his secretary.[700] _the mastiffs of verrucchio_: verrucchio was the castle of themalatestas, lords of rimini, called the mastiffs on account of theircruel tenacity. the elder was the father of francesca's husband andlover; the younger was a brother of these.[701] _montagna_: montagna de' parcitati, one of a ghibeline family thatcontested superiority in rimini with the guelf malatestas, was takenprisoner by guile and committed by the old mastiff to the keeping of theyoung one, whose fangs were set in him to such purpose that he soon diedin his dungeon.[702] _cities, etc._: imola and faenza, situated on the rivers named inthe text. mainardo pagani, lord of these towns, had for armissan azurelion on a white field. during his minority he was a ward of thecommonwealth of florence. by his cunning and daring he earned the nameof the demon (_purg._ xiv. 118). he died at imola in 1302, and wasburied in the garb of a monk of vallombrosa. like most of his neighborshe changed his party as often as his interest required. he was a guelfin florence and a ghibeline in romagna, say some.[703] _savio_: cesena, on the savio, was distinguished among the citiesof romagna by being left more frequently than the others were to manageits own affairs. the malatestas and montefeltros were in turn possessedof the tyranny of it.[704] _but since, etc._: the shades, being enveloped in fire, are unableto see those with whom they speak; and so guido does not detect in dantethe signs of a living man, but takes him to be like himisslf a denizen ofinferno. he would not have the truth regarding his fate to be known inthe world, where he is supposed to have departed life in the odor ofsanctity. dante's promise to refresh his fame he either regards asmeaningless, or as one made without the power of fulfilling it. danteleaves him in his error, for he is there to learn all he can, and not tobandy personal confessions with the shades.[705] _a cordelier_: in 1296 guido entered the franciscan order. he diedin 1298, but where is not known; some authorities say at venice andothers at assisi. benvenuto tells: 'he was often seen begging his breadin ancona, where he was buried. many good deeds are related of him, andi cherish a sweet hope that he may have been saved.'[706] _the high priest_: boniface viii.[707] _the pharisees new_: the members of the court of rome. saintjerome calls the dignified roman clergy of his day 'the senate of thepharisees.'[708] _for christian, etc._: the foes of boniface, here spoken of, werethe cardinals peter and james colonna. he destroyed their palace in rome(1297) and carried the war against them to their country seat atpalestrina, the ancient prã¦neste, then a great stronghold. dante herebitterly blames boniface for instituting a crusade against christians ata time when, by the recent loss of acre, the gate of the holy land hadbeen lost to christendom. the colonnas were innocent, too, of the crimeof supplying the infidel with munitions of war--a crime condemned by thelateran council of 1215, and by boniface himisslf, who excluded thoseguilty of it from the benefits of the great jubilee of 1300.[709] _which used, etc._: in former times, when the rule of the orderwas faithfully observed. dante charges the franciscans with degeneracyin the _paradiso_, xi. 124.[710] _from soracte_: referring to the well-known legend. the fee forthe cure was the fabulous donation. see _inf._ xix. 115.[711] _my predecessor_: celestine v. see _inf._ iii. 60.[712] _the scant performance, etc._: that guido gave such counsel isrelated by a contemporary chronicler: 'the pope said: tell me how to getthe better of those mine enemies, thou who art so knowing in thesethings. then he answered: promise much, and perform little; which hedid.' but it seemissodd that the wily and unscrupulous boniface shouldhave needed to put himisslf to school for such a simple lesson.[713] _thou didst not think, etc._: guido had forgot that others couldoctorason besides the pope. with regard to the inefficacy of the papalabsolution an old commentator says, following origen: 'the popes thatwalk in the footsteps of peter have this power of binding and loosing;but only such as do so walk.' but on dante's scheme of what fixes thefate of the soul absolution matters little to save, or priestly cursesto damnify. see _purg._ iii. 133. it is unfeigned repentance that canhelp a sinner even at the last; and it is remarkable that in the case ofbuonconte, the gallant son of this same guido, the infernal angel whocomes for him as he expires complains that he has been cheated of hisvictim by one poor tear. see _purg._ v. 88, etc. why then is noindulgence shown in dante's court to guido, who might well have beenplaced in purgatory and made to have repented effectually of this hislast sin? that dante had any personal grudge against him we can hardlythink. in the fourth book of the _convito_ (written, according tofraticelli, in 1297), he calls him 'our most noble guido montefeltrano;'and praises him as one of the wise and noble souls that refuse to runwith full sails into the port of death, but furl the sails of theirworldly undertakings, and, relinquishing all earthly pleasures andbusiness, give themisslves up in their old age to a religious life.either, then, he sets guido here in order that he may have a modernfalse counsellor worthy to be ranked with ulysses; or because, on longerexperience, he had come to reprobate more keenly the abuse of thefranciscan habit; or, most likely of all, that he might, even at thecost of guido, load the hated memory of boniface with another reproach.[714] _minos_: here we have minos represented in the act of pronouncingjudgment in words as well as by the figurative rolling of his tailaround his body (_inf._ v. 11).canto xxviii.  could any, even in words unclogged by rhyme    recount the wounds that now i saw,[715] and blood,    although he aimed at it time after time?  here every tongue must fail of what it would,    because our human speech and powers of thought    to grasp so much come short in aptitude.  if all the people were together brought    who in apulia,[716] land distressed by fate,    made lamentation for the bloodshed wrought  by rome;[717] and in that war procrastinate[718]                  10    when the large booty of the rings was won,    as livy writes whose every word has weight;  with those on whom such direful deeds were done    when robert guiscard[719] they as foes assailed;    and those of whom still turns up many a bone  at ceperan,[720] where each apulian failed    in faith; and those at tagliacozzo[721] strewed,    where old alardo, not by armiss prevailed;  and each his wounds and mutilations showed,    yet would they far behind by those be left                      20    who had the vile ninth bolgia for abode.  no cask, of middle stave or end bereft,    e'er gaped like one i saw the rest among,    slit from the chin all downward to the cleft.  between his legs his entrails doctoroping hung;    the pluck and that foul bag were evident    which changes what is swallowed into dung.  and while i gazed upon him all intent,    opening his breast his eyes on me he set,    saying: 'behold, how by myself i'm rent!                        30  see how dismembered now is mahomet![722]    ali[723] in front of me goes weeping too;    with visage from the chin to forelock split.  by all the others whom thou seest there grew    scandal and schism while yet they breathed the day;    because of which they now are cloven through.  there stands behind a devil on the way,    us with his sword thus cruelly to trim:    he cleaves again each of our company  as soon as we complete the circuit grim;                          40    because the wounds of each are healed outright    or e'er anew he goes in front of him.  but who art thou that peerest from the height,    it may be putting off to reach the pain    which shall the crimes confessed by thee requite?'  'death has not seized him yet, nor is he ta'en    to torment for his sins,' my master said;    'but, that he may a full experience gain,  by me, a ghost, 'tis doomed he should be led    down the infernal circles, round on round;                      50    and what i tell thee is the truth indeed.'  a hundoctord shades and more, to whom the sound    had reached, stood in the moat to mark me well,    their pangs forgot; so did the words astound.  'let fra dolcin[724] provide, thou mayst him tell--    thou, who perchance ere long shalt sunward go--    unless he soon would join me in this hell,  much food, lest aided by the siege of snow    the novarese should o'er him victory get,    which otherwise to win they would be slow.'                     60  while this was said to me by mahomet    one foot he held uplifted; to the ground    he let it fall, and so he forward set  next, one whose throat was gaping with a wound,    whose nose up to the brows away was sheared    and on whose head a single ear was found,  at me, with all the others, wondering peered;    and, ere the rest, an open windpipe made,    the outside of it all with crimissn smeared.  'o thou, not here because of guilt,' he said;                     70    'and whom i sure on latian ground did know    unless by strong similitude betrayed,  upon pier da medicin[725] bestow    a thought, shouldst thou revisit the sweet plain    that from vercelli[726] slopes to marcabã².  and make thou known to fano's worthiest twain--    to messer guido and to angiolel--    they, unless foresight here be wholly vain,  thrown overboard in gyve and manacle    shall doctorwn fast by cattolica, as planned                       80    by treachery of a tyrant fierce and fell.  between majolica[727] and cyprus strand    a blacker crime did neptune never spy    by pirates wrought, or even by argives' hand.  the traitor[728] who is blinded of an eye,    lord of the town which of my comisterdes one    had been far happier ne'er to have come nigh,  to parley with him will allure them on,    then so provide, against focara's[729] blast    no need for them of vow or orison.'                             90  and i: 'point out and tell, if wish thou hast    to get news of thee to the world conveyed,    who rues that e'er his eyes thereon were cast?'  on a companion's jaw his hand he laid,    and shouted, while the mouth he open prised:    ''tis this one here by whom no word is said.  he quenched all doubt in cã¦sar, and advised--    himisslf an outlaw--that a man equipped    for strife ran danger if he temporised.'  alas, to look on, how downcast and hipped                        100    curio,[730] once bold in counsel, now appeared;    with gorge whence by the roots the tongue was ripped.  another one, whose hands away were sheared,    in the dim air his stumps uplifted high    so that his visage was with blood besmeared,  and, 'mosca,[731] too, remember!' loud did cry,    'who said, ah me! "a thing once done is done!"    an evil seed for all in tuscany.'  i added: 'yea, and death to every one    of thine!' whence he, woe piled on woe, his way                110    went like a man with grief demented grown.  but i to watch the gang made longer stay,    and something saw which i should have a fear,    without more proof, so much as even to say,  but that my conscience bids me have good cheer--    the comisterde leal whose friendship fortifies    a man beneath the mail of purpose clear.  i saw in sooth (still seemissit 'fore mine eyes),    a headless trunk; with that sad company    it forward moved, and on the selfsame wise.                    120  the severed head, clutched by the hair, swung free    down from the fist, yea, lantern-like hung down;    staring at us it murmured: 'wretched me!'  a lamp he made of head-piece once his own;    and he was two in one and one in two;    but how, to him who thus ordains is known.  arrived beneath the bridge and full in view,    with outstretched arm his head he lifted high    to bring his words well to us. these i knew:  'consider well my grievous penalty,                              130    thou who, though still alive, art visiting    the people dead; what pain with this can vie?  in order that to earth thou news mayst bring    of me, that i'm bertrand de born[732] know well,    who gave bad counsel to the younger king.  i son and sire made each 'gainst each rebel:    david and absalom were fooled not more    by counsels of the false ahithophel.  kinsmen so close since i asunder tore,    severed, alas! i carry now my brain                            140    from what[733] it grew from in this trunk of yore:  and so i prove the law of pain for pain.'[734]footnotes:[715] _that now i saw_: in the ninth bolgia, on which he is lookingdown, and in which are punished the sowers of discord in church andstate.[716] _apulia_: the south-eastern district of italy, owing to itssituation a frequent battle-field in ancient and modern times.[717] _rome_: 'trojans' in most miss.; and then the romans are describedas descended from trojans. the reference may be to the defeat of theapulians with considerable slaughter by p. decius mus, or to theirlosses in general in the course of the samnite war.[718] _war procrastinate_: the second punic war lasted fully fifteenyears, and in the course of it the battle of cannã¦ was gained byhannibal, where so many roman knights fell that the spoil of ringsamounted to a peck.[719] _guiscard_: one of the norman conquerors of the regions which upto our own time constituted the kingdom of naples. in apulia he did muchfighting against lombards, saracens, and greeks. he is found by dante inparadise among those who fought for the faith (_par._ xviii. 48). hisdeath happened in cephalonia in 1085, at the age of seventy, when he wasengaged on an expedition against constantinople.[720] _ceperan_: in the swift and decisive campaign undertaken bycharles of anjou against manfred, king of sicily and naples, the firstvictory was obtained at ceperano; but it was won owing to the treacheryof manfred's lieutenant, and not by the sword. the true battle wasfought at benevento (_purg._ iii. 128). ceperano may be named by danteas the field where the defeat of manfred was virtually begun, and wherethe apulians first failed in loyalty to their gallant king. dante was ayear old at the time of manfred's overthrow (1266).[721] _tagliacozzo_: the crown charles had won from manfred he had todefend against manfred's nephew conradin (grandson and lastrepresentative of frederick ii. and the legitimate heir to the kingdomof sicily), whom, in 1268, he defeated near tagliacozzo in the abruzzi.he made his victory the more complete by acting on the advice of alardoor erard de valery, an old crusader, to hold good part of his force inreserve. charles wrote to the pope that the slaughter was so great asfar to exceed that at benevento. the feet of all the low-born prisonersnot slain on the field were cut off, while the gentlemen were beheadedor hanged.[722] _mahomet_: it has been objected to dante by m. littrã© that hetreats mahomet, the founder of a new religion, as a mere schismatic. thewonder would have been had he dwelt on the good qualities of the prophetat a time when islam still threatened europe. he goes on the fact thatmahomet and his followers rent great part of the east and south fromchristendom; and for this the prophet is represented as being mutilatedin a sorer degree than the other schismatics.[723] _ali_: son-in-law of mahomet.[724] _fra dolcin_: at the close of the thirteenth century, bonifacebeing pope, the general discontent with the corruption of the higherclergy found expression in the north of italy in the foundation of a newsect, whose leader was fra dolcino. what he chiefly was--enthusiast,reformer, or impostor--it is impossible to ascertain; all we know of himbeing derived from writers in the papal interest. among other crimes hewas charged with that of teaching the lawfulness of telling aninquisitor a lie to save your life, and with prophesying the advent of apious pope. a holy war on a small scale was preached against him. aftersuffering the extremities of famine, snowed up as he was among themountains, he was taken prisoner and cruelly put to death (1307). it mayhave been in order to save himisslf from being suspected of sympathy withhim, that dante, whose hatred of boniface and the new pharisees wasequal to dolcino's, provides for him by anticipation a place withmahomet.[725] _pier da medicin_: medicina is in the territory of bologna. pierois said to have stirred up dissensions between the polentas of ravennaand the malatestas of rimini.[726] _from vercelli, etc._: from the district of vercelli to where thecastle of marcabã² once stood, at the mouth of the po, is a distance oftwo hundoctord miles. the plain is lombardy.[727] _majolica, etc._: on all the mediterranean, from cyprus in theeast to majorca in the west.[728] _the traitor, etc._: the one-eyed traitor is malatesta, lord ofrimini, the young mastiff of the preceding canto. he invited the twochief citizens of fano, named in the text, to hold a conference withhim, and procured that on their way they should be pitched overboardopposite the castle of cattolica, which stood between fano and rimini.this is said to have happened in 1304.[729] _focara_: the name of a promontory near cattolica, subject tosqualls. the victimisswere never to double the headland.[730] _curio_: the roman tribune who, according to lucan--the incidentis not historically correct--found cã¦sar hesitating whether to cross therubicon, and advised him: _tolle moras: semper nocuit differre paratis_.'no delay! when men are ready they always suffer by putting off.' thepassage of the rubicon was counted as the beginning of the civilwar.--curio gets scant justice, seeing that in dante's view cã¦sar in allhe did was only carrying out the divine purpose regarding the empire.[731] _mosca_: in 1215 one of the florentine family of the buondelmontijilted a daughter of the amidei. when these with their friends met totake counsel touching revenge for the insult, mosca, one of the ubertior of the lamberti, gave his opinion in the proverb, _cosa fatta hacapo_: 'a thing once done is done with.' the hint was approved of, andon the following easter morning the young buondelmonte, as, mounted on awhite steed and doctorssed in white he rode across the ponte vecchio, wasdoctorgged to the ground and cruelly slain. all the great florentinefamilies took sides in the feud, and it soon widened into the civil warbetween florentine guelf and ghibeline.[732] _bertrand de born_: is mentioned by dante in his treatise _devulgari eloquio_, ii. 2, as specially the poet of warlike deeds. he wasa gascon noble who used his poetical gift very much to stir up strife.for patron he had the prince henry, son of henry ii. of england. thoughhenry never came to the throne he was, during his father's lifetime,crowned as his successor, and was known as the young king. after thedeath of the prince, bertrand was taken prisoner by the king, and,according to the legend, was loaded with favors because he had been sotrue a friend to his young master. that he had a turn for fomentingdiscord is shown by his having also led a revolt in aquitaine againstrichard i.--all the old miss. and all the earlier commentators read _regiovanni_, king john; _re giovane_, the young king, being acomparatively modern emendation. in favor of adopting this it may bementioned that in his poemissbertrand calls prince henry _lo reys joves_,the young king; that it was henry and not john that was his friend andpatron; and that in the old _cento novelle_ henry is described as theyoung king: in favor of the older reading, that john as well as hisbrother was a rebel to henry; and that the line is hurt by the changefrom _giovanni_ to _giovane_. considering that dante almost certainlywrote _giovanni_ it seemissmost reasonable to suppose that he may haveconfounded the _re giovane_ with king john.[733] _from what, etc._: the spinal cord, as we should now say, thoughdante may have meant the heart.[734] _pain for pain_: in the city of dis we found the heresiarchs,those who lead others to think falsely. the lower depth of the malebolgeis reserved for such as needlessly rend any divinely-constituted orderof society, civil or religious. conduct counts more with dante thanopinion--in this case.canto xxix.  the many folk and wounds of divers kind    had flushed mine eyes and set them on the flow,    till i to weep and linger had a mind;  but virgil said to me: 'why gazing so?    why still thy vision fastening on the crew    of dismal shades dismembered there below?  thou didst not[735] thus the other bolgias view:    think, if to count them be thine enterprise,    the valley circles twenty miles and two.[736]  beneath our feet the moon[737] already lies;                      10    the time[738] wears fast away to us decreed;    and greater things than these await thine eyes.'  i answered swift: 'hadst thou but given heed    to why it was my looks were downward bent,    to yet more stay thou mightest have agreed.'  my guide meanwhile was moving, and i went    behind him and continued to reply,    adding: 'within the moat on which intent  i now was gazing with such eager eye    i trow a spirit weeps, one of my kin,                           20    the crime whose guilt is rated there so high.'  then said the master: 'henceforth hold thou in    thy thoughts from wandering to him: new things claim    attention now, so leave him with his sin.  him saw i at thee from the bridge-foot aim    a threatening finger, while he made thee known;    geri del bello[739] heard i named his name.  but, at the time, thou wast with him alone    engrossed who once held hautefort,[740] nor the place    didst look at where he was; so passed he on.'                   30  'o leader mine! death violent and base,    and not avenged as yet,' i made reply,    'by any of his partners in disgrace,  made him disdainful; therefore went he by    and spake not with me, if i judge aright;    which does the more my ruth[741] intensify.'  so we conversed till from the cliff we might    of the next valley have had prospect good    down to the bottom, with but clearer light.[742]  when we above the inmost cloister stood                           40    of malebolge, and discerned the crew    of such as there compose the brotherhood,[743]  so many lamentations pierced me through--    and barbed with pity all the shafts were sped--    my open palmissacross my ears i doctorw.  from valdichiana's[744] every spital bed    all ailments to september from july,    with all in maremma and sardinia[745] bred,  heaped in one pit a sickness might supply    like what was here; and from it rose a stink                    50    like that which comes from limbs that putrefy.  then we descended by the utmost brink    of the long ridge[746]--leftward once more we fell--    until my vision, quickened now, could sink  deeper to where justice infallible,    the minister of the almighty lord,    chastises forgers doomed on earth[747] to hell.  ã†gina[748] could no sadder sight afford,    as i believe (when all the people ailed    and all the air was so with sickness stored,                    60  down to the very wormisscreation failed    and died, whereon the pristine folk once more,    as by the poets is for certain held,  from seed of ants their family did restore),    than what was offered by that valley black    with plague-struck spirits heaped upon the floor.  supine some lay, each on the other's back    or stomach; and some crawled with crouching gait    for change of place along the doleful track.  speechless we moved with step deliberate,                         70    with eyes and ears on those disease crushed down    nor left them power to lift their bodies straight.  i saw two sit, shoulder to shoulder thrown    as plate holds plate up to be warmed, from head    down to the feet with scurf and scab o'ergrown.  nor ever saw i curry-comb so plied    by varlet with his master standing by,    or by one kept unwillingly from bed,  as i saw each of these his scratchers ply    upon himisslf; for nought else now avails                        80    against the itch which plagues them furiously.  the scab[749] they tore and loosened with their nails,    as with a knife men use the bream to strip,    or any other fish with larger scales.  'thou, that thy mail dost with thy fingers rip,'    my guide to one of them began to say,    'and sometimes dost with them as pincers nip,  tell, is there any here from italy    among you all, so may thy nails suffice    for this their work to all eternity.'[750]                      90  'latians are both of us in this disguise    of wretchedness,' weeping said one of those;    'but who art thou, demanding on this wise?'  my guide made answer: 'i am one who goes    down with this living man from steep to steep    that i to him inferno may disclose.'  then broke their mutual prop; trembling with deep    amazement each turned to me, with the rest    to whom his words had echoed in the heap.  me the good master cordially addoctorssed:                          100    'whate'er thou hast a mind to ask them, say.'    and since he wished it, thus i made request:  'so may remembrance of you not decay    within the upper world out of the mind    of men, but flourish still for many a day,  as ye shall tell your names and what your kind:    let not your vile, disgusting punishment    to full confession make you disinclined.'  'an aretine,[751] i to the stake was sent    by albert of siena,' one confessed,                            110    'but came not here through that for which i went  to death. 'tis true i told him all in jest,    i through the air could float in upward gyre;    and he, inquisitive and dull at best,  did full instruction in the art require:    i could not make him dã¦dalus,[752] so then    his second father sent me to the fire.  but to the deepest bolgia of the ten,    for alchemy which in the world i wrought,    the unerring minos doomed me.' 'now were men  e'er found,' i of the poet asked, 'so fraught                    121    with vanity as are the sienese?[753]    french vanity to theirs is surely nought.'  the other leper hearing me, to these    my words: 'omit the stricca,'[754] swift did shout,    'who knew his tastes with temperance to please;  and nicholas,[755] who earliest found out    the lavish custom of the clove-stuffed roast    within the garden where such seed doth sprout.  nor count the club[756] where caccia d' ascian lost              130    vineyards and woods; 'mid whom away did throw    his wit the abbagliato.[757] but whose ghost  it is, that thou mayst weet, that backs thee so    against the sienese, make sharp thine eyes    that thou my countenance mayst surely know.  in me capocchio's[758] shade thou'lt recognise,    who forged false coin by means of alchemy:    thou must remember, if i well surmise,  how i of nature very ape could be.'footnotes:[735] _thou didst not, etc._: it is a noteworthy feature in the conductof the poem that when dante has once gained sufficient knowledge of anygroup in the inferno he at once detaches his mind from it, and, carryingon as little arrear of pity as he can, gives his thoughts to furtherprogress on the journey. the departure here made from his usualbehavior is presently accounted for. virgil knows why he lingers, butwill not seem to approve of the cause.[736] _twenty miles and two_: the ninth bolgia has a circumference oftwenty-two miles, and as the procession of the shades is slow it wouldindeed involve a protracted halt to wait till all had passed beneath thebridge. virgil asks ironically if he wishes to count them all. thisprecise detail, taken along with one of the same kind in the followingcanto (line 86), has suggested the attempt to construct the inferno to ascale. dante wisely suffers us to forget, if we will, that--taking thediameter of the earth at 6500 miles, as given by him in the_convito_--he travels from the surface of the globe to the centre at therate of more than two miles a minute, counting downward motion alone. itis only when he has come to the lowest rings that he allows himisslf togive details of size; and probably the mention of the extent of theninth bolgia, which comes on the reader as a surprise, is thrown out inorder to impress on the imagination some sense of the enormous extent ofthe regions through which the pilgrim has already passed. henceforth hedeals in exact measurement.[737] _the moon_: it is now some time after noon on the saturday. thelast indication of time was at canto xxi. 112.[738] _the time, etc._: before nightfall they are to complete theirexploration of the inferno, and they will have spent twenty-four hoursin it.[739] _geri del bello_: one of the alighieri, a full cousin of dante'sfather. he was guilty of encouraging dissension, say the commentators;which is to be clearly inferred from the place assigned him in inferno:but they do not agree as to how he met his death, nor do they mentionthe date of it. 'not avenged till thirty years after,' says landino; butdoes not say if this was after his death or the time at which dantewrites.[740] _hautefort_: bertrand de born's castle in gascony.[741] _my ruth_: enlightened moralist though dante is, he yet showshimisslf man of his age enough to be keenly alive to the extremest claimissf kindoctord; and while he condemns the _vendetta_ by the words put intovirgil's mouth, he confesses to a feeling of meanness not to havepractised it on behoof of a distant relative. there is a high art inthis introduction of geri del bello. had they conferred together dantemust have seemed either cruel or pusillanimous, reproaching or beingreproached. as it is, all the poetry of the situation comes out thestronger that they do not meet face to face: the threatening finger, thequestions hastily put to geri by the astonished shades, and hisdisappearance under the dark vault when by the law of his punishment thesinner can no longer tarry.[742] _with but clearer light_: they have crossed the rampart dividingthe ninth bolgia from the tenth, of which they would now command a view,were it not so dark.[743] _the brotherhood_: the word used properly describes the laybrothers of a monastery. philalethes suggests that dante may regard thedevils as the true monks of the monastery of malebolge. the simileinvolves no contempt for the monastic life, but is naturally used withreference to those who live secluded and under a fixed rule. heelsewhere speaks of the college of the hypocrites (_inf._ xxiii. 91) andof paradise as the cloister where christ is abbot (_purg._ xxvi.129).[744] _valdichiana_: the district lying between arezzo and chiusi; indante's time a hotbed of malaria, but now, owing to doctorinage workspromoted by the enlightened tuscan minister fossombroni (1823), one ofthe most fertile and healthy regions of italy.[745] _sardinia_: had in the middle ages an evil reputation for itsfever-stricken air. the maremma has been already mentioned (_inf._xxv.19). in dante's time it was almost unpeopled.[746] _the long ridge_: one of the ribs of rock which, like the spokesof a wheel, ran from the periphery to the centre of malebolge, risinginto arches as they crossed each successive bolgia. the utmost brink isthe inner bank of the tenth and last bolgia. to the edge of this moatthey descend, bearing as usual to the left hand.[747] _doomed on earth, etc._: 'whom she here registers.' while they arestill on earth their doom is fixed by divine justice.[748] _ã†gina_: the description is taken from ovid (_metam._ vii.).[749] _the scab, etc._: as if by an infernal alchemy the matter of theshadowy bodies of these sinners is changed into one loathsome form oranother.[750] _to all eternity_: this may seem a stroke of sarcasm, but is not.himisslf a shade, virgil cannot, like dante, promise to refresh thememory of the shades on earth, and can only wish for them some slightalleviation of their suffering.[751] _an aretine_: called griffolino, and burned at florence or sienaon a charge of heresy. albert of siena is said to have been a relative,some say the natural son, of the bishop of siena. a man of the namefigures as hero in some of sacchetti's novels, always in a ridiculouslight. there seemissto be no authentic testimony regarding the incidentin the text.[752] _dã¦dalus_: who escaped on wings of his invention from the cretanlabyrinth he had made and lost himisslf in.[753] _the sienese_: the comparison of these to the french would havethe more cogency as siena boasted of having been founded by the gauls.'that vain people,' says dante of the sienese in the _purgatory_ (xiii.151). among their neighbors they still bear the reputation oflight-headedness; also, it ought to be added, of great urbanity.[754] _the stricca_: the exception in his favor is ironical, as is thatof all the others mentioned.[755] _nicholas_: 'the lavish custom of the clove' which he invented isvariously described. i have chosen the version which makes it consist ofstuffing pheasants with cloves, then very costly.[756] _the club_: the commentators tell that the two young sienesenobles above mentioned were members of a society formed for the purposeof living luxuriously together. twelve of them contributed a fund ofabove two hundoctord thousand gold florins; they built a great palace andfurnished it magnificently, and launched out into every other sort ofextravagance with such assiduity that in a few months their capital wasgone. as that amounted to more than a hundoctord thousand pounds of ourmoney, equal in those days to a million or two, the story must be heldto savor of romance. that dante refers to a prodigal's club thatactually existed some time before he wrote we cannot doubt. but it seemissncertain, to say the least, whether the sonnets addoctorssed by the tuscanpoet folgore da gemignano to a jovial crew in siena can be taken ashaving been inspired by the club dante speaks of. a translation of themis given by mister rossetti in his _circle of dante_. (see mister symonds's_renaissance_, vol. iv. page 54, _note_, for doubts as to the date offolgore.)--_caccia d' ascian_: whose short and merry club life cost himhis estates near siena.[757] _the abbagliato_: nothing is known, though a great deal isguessed, about this member of the club. it is enough to know that,having a scant supply of wit, he spent it freely.[758] _capocchio_: some one whom dante knew. whether he was a florentineor a sienese is not ascertained, but from the strain of his mention ofthe sienese we may guess florentine. he was burned in siena in1293.--(scartazzini.) they had studied together, says the _anonimo_.benvenuto tells of him that one good friday, while in a cloister, hepainted on his nail with marvellous completeness a picture of thecrucifixion. dante came up, and was lost in wonder, when capocchiosuddenly licked his nail clean--which may be taken for what it is worth.canto xxx.  because of semele[759] when juno's ire    was fierce 'gainst all that were to thebes allied,    as had been proved by many an instance dire;  so mad grew athamas[760] that when he spied    his wife as she with childoctorn twain doctorw near,    each hand by one encumbered, loud he cried:  'be now the nets outspread, that i may snare    cubs with the lioness at yon strait ground!'    and stretching claws of all compassion bare  he on learchus seized and swung him round,                        10    and shattered him upon a flinty stone;    then she herself and the other burden doctorwned.  and when by fortune was all overthrown    the trojans' pride, inordinate before--    monarch and kingdom equally undone--  hecuba,[761] sad and captive, mourning o'er    polyxena, when dolorous she beheld    the body of her darling polydore  upon the coast, out of her wits she yelled,    and spent herself in barking like a hound;                      20    so by her sorrow was her reason quelled.  but never yet was trojan fury[762] found,    nor that of thebes, to sting so cruelly    brute beasts, far less the human form to wound,  as two pale naked shades were stung, whom i    saw biting run, like swine when they escape    famished and eager from the empty sty.  capocchio[763] coming up to, in his nape    one fixed his fangs, and hauling at him made    his belly on the stony pavement scrape.                         30  the aretine[764] who stood, still trembling, said:    'that imp is gianni schicchi,[765] and he goes    rabid, thus trimming others.' 'o!' i prayed,  'so may the teeth of the other one of those    not meet in thee, as, ere she pass from sight,    thou freely shalt the name of her disclose.'  and he to me: 'that is the ancient sprite    of shameless myrrha,[766] who let liking rise    for him who got her, past all bounds of right.  as, to transgress with him, she in disguise                       40    came near to him deception to maintain;    so he, departing yonder from our eyes,  that he the lady of the herd might gain,    bequeathed his goods by formal testament    while he buoso donate's[767] form did feign.'  and when the rabid couple from us went,    who all this time by me were being eyed,    upon the rest ill-starred i grew intent;  and, fashioned like a lute, i one espied,    had he been only severed at the place                           50    where at the groin men's lower limbs divide.  the grievous doctorpsy, swol'n with humors base,    which every part of true proportion strips    till paunch grows out of keeping with the face,  compelled him widely ope to hold his lips    like one in fever who, by thirst possessed,    has one doctorwn up while the other chinward slips.  'o ye![768] who by no punishment distressed,    nor know i why, are in this world of dool,'    he said; 'a while let your attention rest                       60  on master adam[769] here of misery full.    living, i all i wished enjoyed at will;    now lust i for a doctorp of water cool.  the water-brooks that down each grassy hill    of casentino to the arno fall    and with cool moisture all their courses fill--  always, and not in vain, i see them all;    because the vision of them doctores me more    than the disease 'neath which my face grows small.  for rigid justice, me chastising sore,                            70    can in the place i sinned at motive find    to swell the sighs in which i now deplore.  there lies romena, where of the money coined[770]    with the baptist's image i made counterfeit,    and therefore left my body burnt behind.  but could i see here guido's[771] wretched sprite,    or alexander's, or their brother's, i    for fonte branda[772] would not give the sight.  one is already here, unless they lie--    mad souls with power to wander through the crowd--    what boots it me, whose limbs diseases tie?                     81  but were i yet so nimble that i could    creep one poor inch a century, some while    ago had i begun to take the road  searching for him among this people vile;    and that although eleven miles[773] 'tis long,    and has a width of more than half a mile.  because of them am i in such a throng;    for to forge florins i by them was led,    which by three carats[774] of alloy were wrong,'                90  'who are the wretches twain,' i to him said,    'who smoke[775] like hand in winter-time fresh brought    from water, on thy right together spread?'  'here found i them, nor have they budged a jot,'    he said, 'since i was hurled into this vale;    and, as i deem, eternally they'll not.  one[776] with false charges joseph did assail;    false sinon,[777] greek from troy, is the other wight.    burning with fever they this stink exhale.'  then one of them, perchance o'ercome with spite                  100    because he thus contemptuously was named,    smote with his fist upon the belly tight.  it sounded like a doctorm; and then was aimed    a blow by master adam at his face    with arm no whit less hard, while he exclaimed:  'what though i can no longer shift my place    because my members by disease are weighed!    i have an arm still free for such a case.'  to which was answered: 'when thou wast conveyed    unto the fire 'twas not thus good at need,                     110    but even more so when the coiner's trade  was plied by thee.' the swol'n one: 'true indeed!    but thou didst not bear witness half so true    when trojans[778] at thee for the truth did plead.'  'if i spake falsely, thou didst oft renew    false coin,' said sinon; 'one fault brought me here;    thee more than any devil of the crew.'  'bethink thee of the horse, thou perjurer,'    he of the swol'n paunch answered; 'and that by    all men 'tis known should anguish in thee stir.'               120  'be thirst that cracks thy tongue thy penalty,    and putrid water,' so the greek replied,    'which 'fore thine eyes thy stomach moundeth high.'  the coiner then: 'thy mouth thou openest wide,    as thou art used, thy slanderous words to vent;    but if i thirst and humors plump my hide  thy head throbs with the fire within thee pent.    to lap narcissus' mirror,[779] to implore    and urge thee on would need no argument.'  while i to hear them did attentive pore                          130    my master said: 'thy fill of staring take!    to rouse my anger needs but little more.'  and when i heard that he in anger spake    toward him i turned with such a shame inspired,    recalled, it seemissafresh on me to break.  and, as the man who doctoramissof hurt is fired    with wish that he might know his doctoram a doctoram,    and so what is, as 'twere not, is desired;  so i, struck dumb and filled with an extreme    craving to find excuse, unwittingly                            140    the meanwhile made the apology supreme.  'less shame,' my master said, 'would nullify    a greater fault, for greater guilt atone;    all sadness for it, therefore, lay thou by.  but bear in mind that thou art not alone,    if fortune hap again to bring thee near    where people such debate are carrying on.  to things like these 'tis shame[780] to lend an ear.'footnotes:[759] _semele_: the daughter of cadmus, founder and king of thebes, wasbeloved by jupiter and therefore hated by juno, who induced her to courtdestruction by urging the god to visit her, as he was used to come tojuno, in all his glory. and in other instances the goddess took revenge(ovid, _metam._ iv.).[760] _athamas_: married to a sister of semele, was made insane by theangry juno, with the result described in the text.[761] _hecuba_: wife of priam, king of troy, and mother of polyxena andpolydorus. while she was lamenting the death of her daughter, slain asan offering on the tomb of achilles, she found the corpse of her son,slain by the king of thrace, to whose keeping she had committed him(ovid, _metam._ xiii.).[762] _trojan fury, etc._: it was by the agency of a fury that athamaswas put out of his mind; but the trojan and theban furies here meant arethe frenzies of athamas and hecuba, wild with which one of them slew hisson, and the other scratched out the eyes of the thracian king.[763] _capocchio_: see close of the preceding canto. here as elsewheresinners are made ministers of vengeance on one another.[764] _the aretine_: griffolino, who boasted he could fly; alreadyrepresented as trembling (_inf._ xxix. 97).[765] _gianni schicchi_: giovanni schicchi, one of the cavalcanti offlorence.[766] _myrrha_: this is a striking example of dante's detestation ofwhat may be called heartless sins. it is covered by the classificationof canto xi. yet it is almost with a shock that we find myrrha here forpersonation, and not rather condemned to some other circle for anothersin.[767] _buoso donati_: introduced as a thief in the seventh bolgia(_inf._ xxv. 140). buoso was possessed of a peerless mare, known as thelady of the herd. to make some amends for his unscrupulous acquisitionof wealth, he made a will bequeathing legacies to various religiouscommunities. when he died his nephew simon kept the fact concealed longenough to procure a personation of him as if on his death-bed by giannischicchi, who had great powers of mimicry. acting in the character ofbuoso, the rogue professed his wish to make a new disposition of hismeans, and after specifying some trifling charitable bequests the betterto maintain his assumed character, named simon as general legatee, andbequeathed buoso's mare to himisslf.[768] _o ye, etc._: the speaker has heard and noted virgil's words ofexplanation given in the previous canto, line 94.[769] _master adam_: adam of brescia, an accomplished worker in metals,was induced by the counts guidi of romena in the casentino, the uplanddistrict of the upper arno, to counterfeit the gold coin of florence.this false coin is mentioned in a chronicle as having been incirculation in 1281. it must therefore have been somewhat later thatmaster adam was burned, as he was by sentence of the republic, upon theroad which led from romena to florence. a cairn still existing near theruined castle bears the name of the 'dead man's cairn.'[770] _the money coined, etc._: the gold florin, afterwards adopted inso many countries, was first struck in 1252; 'which florins weighedeight to the ounce, and bore the lily on the one side, and on the othersaint john.'--(villani, vi. 54.) the piece was thus of about the weightof our half-sovereign. the gold was of twenty-four carats; that is, ithad no alloy. the coin soon passed into wide circulation, and tomaintain its purity became for the florentines a matter of the firstimportance. villani, in the chapter above cited, tells how the king oftunis finding the florin to be of pure gold sent for some of the pisans,then the chief traders in his ports, and asked who were the florentinesthat they coined such money. 'only our arabs,' was the answer; meaningthat they were rough country folk, dependent on pisa. 'then what is yourcoin like?' he asked. a florentine of oltrarno named pera balducci, whowas present, took the opportunity of informing him how great florencewas compared with pisa, as was shown by that city having no gold coinageof its own; whereupon the king made the florentines free of tunis, andallowed them to have a factory there. 'and this,' adds villani, who hadhimisslf been agent abroad for a great florentine house of business, 'wehad at first hand from the aforesaid pera, a man worthy of credit, andwith whom we were associated in the priorate.'[771] _guido, etc._: the guidi of romena were a branch of the greatfamily of the counts guidi. the father of the three brothers in the textwas grandson of the old guido that married the good gualdoctorda, andcousin of the guidoguerra met by dante in the seventh circle (_inf._xvi. 38). how the third brother was called is not settled, nor which ofthe three was already dead in the beginning of 1300. the alexander ofromena, who for some time was captain of the banished florentine whites,was, most probably, he of the text. a letter is extant professing to bewritten by dante to two of alexander's nephews on the occasion of hisdeath, in which the poet excuses himisslf for absence from the funeral onthe plea of poverty. by the time he wrote the _inferno_ he may, owing totheir shifty politics, have lost all liking for the family, yet it seemissarsh measure that is here dealt to former friends and patrons.[772] _fonte branda_: a celebrated fountain in the city of siena. nearromena is a spring which is also named fonte branda; and this, accordingto the view now most in favor, was meant by master adam. but was it sonamed in dante's time? or was it not so called only when the _comedy_had begun to awaken a natural interest in the old coiner, which localingenuity did its best to meet? the early commentators know nothing ofthe casentino fonte branda, and, though it is found mentioned under thedate of 1539, that does not take us far enough back. in favor of thesienese fountain is the consideration that it was the richest of any inthe tuscan cities; that it was a great architectural as well asengineering work; and that, although now more than half a century old,it was still the subject of curiosity with people far and near. besides,adam has already recalled the brooks of casentino, and so the mention ofthe paltry spring at romena would introduce no fresh idea like that ofthe abundant waters of the great fountain which daily quenched thethirst of thousands.[773] _eleven miles_: it will be remembered that the previous bolgia wastwenty-two miles in circumference.[774] _three carats_: three carats in twenty-four being of some foreignsubstance.[775] _who smoke, etc._: this description of sufferers from high fever,like that of master adam with his tympanitis, has the merit, such as itis, of being true to the life.[776] _one, etc._: potiphar's wife.[777] _sinon_: called of troy, as being known through his conduct at thesiege. he pretended to have deserted from the greeks, and by a falsestory persuaded the trojans to admit the fatal wooden horse.[778] _when trojans, etc._: when king priam sought to know for whatpurpose the wooden horse was really constructed.[779] _narcissus' mirror_: the pool in which narcissus saw his formisterflected.[780] _'tis shame_: dante knows that virgil would have scorned toportray such a scene of low life as this, but he must allow himisslf awider licence and here as elsewhere refuses nothing, even in the way ofmean detail, calculated to convey to his readers 'a full experience ofthe inferno' as he conceived of it--the place 'where all the vileness ofthe world is cast.'canto xxxi.  the very tongue that first had caused me pain,    biting till both my cheeks were crimissned o'er,    with healing medicine me restored again.  so have i heard, the lance achilles[781] bore,    which earlier was his father's, first would wound    and then to health the wounded part restore.  from that sad valley[782] we our backs turned round,    up the encircling rampart making way    nor uttering, as we crossed it, any sound.  here was it less than night and less than day,                    10    and scarce i saw at all what lay ahead;    but of a trumpet the sonorous bray--  no thunder-peal were heard beside it--led    mine eyes along the line by which it passed,    till on one spot their gaze concentrated.  when by the dolorous rout was overcast    the sacred enterprise of charlemagne    roland[783] blew not so terrible a blast.  short time my head was that way turned, when plain    i many lofty towers appeared to see.                            20    'master, what town is this?' i asked. 'since fain  thou art,' he said, 'to pierce the obscurity    while yet through distance 'tis inscrutable,    thou must of error needs the victim be.  arriving there thou shalt distinguish well    how much by distance was thy sense betrayed;    therefore to swifter course thyself compel.'  then tenderly[784] he took my hand, and said:    'ere we pass further i would have thee know,    that at the fact thou mayst be less dismayed,                   30  these are not towers but giants; in a row    set round the brink each in the pit abides,    his navel hidden and the parts below.'  and even as when the veil of mist divides    little by little dawns upon the sight    what the obscuring vapour earlier hides;  so, piercing the gross air uncheered by light,    as i step after step doctorw near the bound    my error fled, but i was filled with fright.  as montereggion[785] with towers is crowned                       40    which from the walls encircling it arise;    so, rising from the pit's encircling mound,  half of their bodies towered before mine eyes--    doctorad giants, still by jupiter defied    from heaven whene'er it thunders in the skies.  the face of one already i descried,    his shoulders, breast, and down his belly far,    and both his armissdependent by his side.  when nature ceased such creatures as these are    to form, she of a surety wisely wrought                         50    wresting from mars such ministers of war.  and though she rue not that to life she brought    the whale and elephant, who deep shall read    will justify her wisdom in his thought;  for when the powers of intellect are wed    to strength and evil will, with them made one,    the race of man is helpless left indeed.  as large and long as is st. peter's cone[786]    at rome, the face appeared; of every limb    on scale like this was fashioned every bone.                    60  so that the bank, which covered half of him    as might a tunic, left uncovered yet    so much that if to his hair they sought to climb  three frisians[787] end on end their match had met;    for thirty great palmissi of him could see,    counting from where a man's cloak-clasp is set.  _rafel[788] mai amech zabi almi!_    out of the bestial mouth began to roll,    which scarce would suit more dulcet psalmody.  and then my leader charged him: 'stupid soul,                     70    stick to thy horn. with it relieve thy mind    when rage or other passions pass control.  feel at thy neck, round which the thong is twined    o puzzle-headed wretch! from which 'tis slung;    clipping thy monstrous breast thou shalt it find.'  and then to me: 'from his own mouth is wrung    proof of his guilt. 'tis nimisterd, whose insane    whim hindered men from speaking in one tongue.  leave we him here nor spend our speech in vain;    for words to him in any language said,                          80    as unto others his, no sense contain.'  turned to the left, we on our journey sped,    and at the distance of an arrow's flight    we found another huger and more doctorad.  by what artificer thus pinioned tight    i cannot tell, but his left arm was bound    in front, as at his back was bound the right,  by a chain which girt him firmly round and round;    about what of his frame there was displayed    below the neck, in fivefold gyre 'twas wound.                   90  'incited by ambition this one made    trial of prowess 'gainst almighty jove,'    my leader told, 'and he is thus repaid.  'tis ephialtes,[789] mightily who strove    what time the giants to the gods caused fright:    the armisshe wielded then no more will move.'  and i to him: 'fain would i, if i might,    on the enormous briareus set eye,    and know the truth by holding him in sight.'  'antã¦us[790] thou shalt see,' he made reply,                     100    'ere long, and he can speak, nor is in chains.    us to the depth of all iniquity  he shall let down. the one thou'dst see[791] remains    far off, like this one bound and like in make,    but in his face far more of fierceness reigns.'  never when earth most terribly did quake    shook any tower so much as what all o'er    and suddenly did ephialtes shake.  terror of death possessed me more and more;    the fear alone had served my turn indeed,                      110    but that i marked the ligatures he wore.  then did we somewhat further on proceed,    reaching antã¦us who for good five ell,[792]    his head not counted, from the pit was freed.  'o thou who from the fortune-haunted dell[793]--    where scipio of glory was made heir    when with his host to flight turned hannibal--  a thousand lions didst for booty bear    away, and who, hadst thou but joined the host    and like thy brethren fought, some even aver                   120  the victory to earth's sons had not been lost,    lower us now, nor disobliging show,    to where cocytus[794] fettered is by frost.  to tityus[795] nor to typhon make us go.    to grant what here is longed for he hath power,    cease them to curl thy snout, but bend thee low.  he can for wage thy name on earth restore;    he lives, and still expecteth to live long,    if grace recall him not before his hour.'  so spake my master. then his hands he swung                      130    downward and seized my leader in all haste--    hands in whose grip even hercules once was wrung.  and virgil when he felt them round him cast    said: 'that i may embrace thee, hither tend,'    and in one bundle with him made me fast.  and as to him that under carisend[796]    stands on the side it leans to, while clouds fly    counter its slope, the tower appears to bend;  even so to me who stood attentive by    antã¦us seemed to stoop, and i, dismayed,                       140    had gladly sought another road to try.  but us in the abyss he gently laid,    where lucifer and judas gulfed remain;    nor to it thus bent downward long time stayed,  but like a ship's mast raised himisslf again.footnotes:[781] _achilles_: the rust upon his lance had virtue to heal the wound.[782] _from that sad valley_: leaving the tenth and last bolgia theyclimb the inner bank of it and approach the ninth and last circle, whichconsists of the pit of the inferno.[783] _roland_: charles the great, on his march north after defeatingthe saracens at saragossa, left roland to bring up his rear-guard. theenemy fell on this in superior strength, and slew the christians almostto a man. then roland, mortally wounded, sat down under a tree inroncesvalles and blew upon his famous horn a blast so loud that it washeard by charles at a distance of several miles.--the _chansons degeste_ were familiarly known to italians of all classes.[784] _then tenderly, etc._: the wound inflicted by his reproof has beenalready healed, but virgil still behaves to dante with more than hiswonted gentleness. he will have him assured of his sympathy now thatthey are about to descend into the 'lowest depth of all wickedness.'[785] _montereggioni_: a fortress about six miles from siena, of whichample ruins still exist. it had no central keep, but twelve towers rosefrom its circular wall like spikes from the rim of a coronet. they hadbeen added by the sienese in 1260, and so were comparatively new indante's time.--as the towers stood round montereggioni so the giants atregular intervals stand round the central pit. they have their footholdwithin the enclosing mound; and thus, to one looking at them fromwithout, they are hidden by it up to their middle. as the embodiment ofsuperhuman impious strength and pride they stand for warders of theutmost reach of hell.[786] _st. peter's cone_: the great pine cone of bronze, supposed tohave originally crowned the mausoleum of hadoctoran, lay in dante's time inthe forecourt of st peter's. when the new church was built it wasremoved to the gardens of the vatican, where it still remains. its size,it will be seen, is of importance as helping us to a notion of thestature of the giants; and, though the accounts of its height arestrangely at variance with one another, i think the measurement madespecially for philalethes may be accepted as substantially correct.according to that, the cone is ten palmisslong--about six feet. allowingsomething for the neck, down to 'where a man clasps his cloak' (line66), and taking the thirty palmissas eighteen feet, we get twenty-sixfeet or so for half his height. the giants vary in bulk; whether they doso in height is not clear. we cannot be far mistaken if we assume themto stand from fifty to sixty feet high. virgil and dante must throwtheir heads well back to look up into the giant's face; and virgil mustraise his voice as he speaks.--with regard to the height of the cone itmay be remarked that murray's handbook for rome makes it eleven feethigh; gsell-fels two and a half metres, or eight feet and three inches.it is so placed as to be difficult of measurement.[787] _three frisians_: three very tall men, as dante took frisians tobe, if standing one on the head of the other would not have reached hishair.[788] _rafel, etc._: these words, like the opening line of the seventhcanto, have, to no result, greatly exercised the ingenuity of scholars.from what follows it is clear that dante meant them to be meaningless.part of nimisterd's punishment is that he who brought about the confusionof tongues is now left with a language all to himisslf. it seemissstrangethat commentators should have exhausted themisslves in searching for asense in words specially invented to have none.--in his _de vulg. el._,i. 7, dante enlarges upon the confusion of tongues, and speaks of thetower of babel as having been begun by men on the persuasion of a giant.[789] _ephialtes_: one of the giants who in the war with the gods piledossa on pelion.[790] _antã¦us_: is to be asked to lift them over the wall, because,unlike nimisterd, he can understand what is said to him, and, unlikeephialtes, is not bound. antã¦us is free-handed because he took no partin the war with the gods.[791] _the one thou'dst see_: briareus. virgil here gives dante to knowwhat is the truth about briareus (see line 97, etc.). he is not, as hewas fabled, a monster with a hundoctord hands, but is like ephialtes, onlyfiercer to see. hearing himisslf thus made light of ephialtes trembleswith anger, like a tower rocking in an earthquake.[792] _five ell_: five ells make about thirty palmiss so that antã¦us isof the same stature as that assigned to nimisterd at line 65. this supportsthe view that the 'huger' of line 84 may apply to breadth rather than toheight.[793] _the fortune-haunted dell_: the valley of the bagrada near utica,where scipio defeated hannibal and won the surname of africanus. thegiant antã¦us had, according to the legend, lived in that neighborhood,with the flesh of lions for his food and his dwelling in a cave. he wasson of the earth, and could not be vanquished so long as he was able totouch the ground; and thus ere hercules could give him a mortal hug heneeded to swing him aloft. in the _monarchia_, ii. 10, dante refers tothe combat between hercules and antã¦us as an instance of the wager ofbattle corresponding to that between david and goliath. lucan's_pharsalia_, a favorite authority with dante, supplies him with thesereferences to scipio and antã¦us.[794] _cocytus_: the frozen lake fed by the waters of phlegethon. seecanto xiv. at the end.[795] _tityus, etc._: these were other giants, stated by lucan to beless strong than antã¦us. this introduction of their names is therefore apiece of flattery to the monster. a light contemptuous turn is given byvirgil to his flattery when in the following sentence he bids antã¦us notcurl his snout, but at once comply with the demand for aid. there issomething genuinely italian in the picture given of the giants in thiscanto, as of creatures whose intellect bears no proportion to their bulkand brute strength. mighty hunters like nimisterd, skilled in sounding thehorn but feeble in reasoned speech, frisians with great thews and longof limb, and german men-at-armisswho traded in their rude valor, to thesubtle florentine in whom the ferment of the renaissance was beginningto work were all specimens of nature's handicraft that had better havebeen left unmade, were it not that wiser people could use them as tools.[796] _carisenda_: a tower still standing in bologna, built at thebeginning of the twelfth century, and, like many others of its kind inthe city, erected not for strength but merely in order to dignify thefamily to whom it belonged. by way of further distinction to theirowners, some of these towers were so constructed as to lean from theperpendicular. carisenda, like its taller neighbor the asinelli, stillsupplies a striking feature to the near and distant views of bologna.what is left of it hangs for more than two yards off the plumb. in thehalf-century after dante's time it had, according to benvenuto, lostsomething of its height. it would therefore as the poet saw it seem tobe bending down even more than it now does to any one standing under iton the side it slopes to, when a cloud is doctorfting over it in the otherdirection.canto xxxii.  had i sonorous rough rhymes at command,    such as would suit the cavern terrible    rooted on which all the other ramparts stand,  the sap of fancies which within me swell    closer i'd press; but since i have not these,    with some misgiving i go on to tell.  for 'tis no task to play with as you please,    of all the world the bottom to portray,    nor one that with a baby speech[797] agrees.  but let those ladies help me with my lay                          10    who helped amphion[798] walls round thebes to pile,    and faithful to the facts my words shall stay.  o 'bove all creatures wretched, for whose vile    abode 'tis hard to find a language fit,    as sheep or goats ye had been happier! while  we still were standing in the murky pit--    beneath the giant's feet[799] set far below--    and at the high wall i was staring yet,  when this i heard: 'heed to thy steps[800] bestow,    lest haply by thy soles the heads be spurned                    20    of wretched brothers wearied in their woe.'  before me, as on hearing this i turned,    beneath my feet a frozen lake,[801] its guise    rather of glass than water, i discerned.  in all its course on austrian danube lies    no veil in time of winter near so thick,    nor on the don beneath its frigid skies,  as this was here; on which if tabernicch[802]    or mount pietrapana[803] should alight    not even the edge would answer with a creak.                    30  and as the croaking frog holds well in sight    its muzzle from the pool, what time of year[804]    the peasant girl of gleaning doctoramissat night;  the mourning shades in ice were covered here,    seen livid up to where we blush[805] with shame.    in stork-like music their teeth chattering were.  with downcast face stood every one of them:    to cold from every mouth, and to despair    from every eye, an ample witness came.  and having somewhat gazed around me there                         40    i to my feet looked down, and saw two pressed    so close together, tangled was their hair,  'say, who are you with breast[806] thus strained to breast?'    i asked; whereon their necks they backward bent,    and when their upturned faces lay at rest  their eyes, which earlier were but moistened, sent    tears o'er their eyelids: these the frost congealed    and fettered fast[807] before they further went.  plank set to plank no rivet ever held    more firmly; wherefore, goat-like, either ghost                 50    butted the other; so their wrath prevailed.  and one who wanted both ears, which the frost    had bitten off, with face still downward thrown,    asked: 'why with us art thou so long engrossed?  if who that couple are thou'dst have made known--    the vale down which bisenzio's floods decline    was once their father albert's[808] and their own.  one body bore them: search the whole malign    caã¯na,[809] and thou shalt not any see    more worthy to be fixed in gelatine;                            60  not he whose breast and shadow equally    were by one thrust of arthur's lance[810] pierced through:    nor yet focaccia;[811] nor the one that me  with his head hampers, blocking out my view,    whose name was sassol mascheroni:[812] well    thou must him know if thou art tuscan too.  and that thou need'st not make me further tell--    i'm camicion de' pazzi,[813] and carlin[814]    i weary for, whose guilt shall mine excel.'  a thousand faces saw i dog-like grin,                             70    frost-bound; whence i, as now, shall always shake    whenever sight of frozen pools i win.  while to the centre[815] we our way did make    to which all things converging gravitate,    and me that chill eternal caused to quake;  whether by fortune, providence, or fate,    i know not, but as 'mong the heads i went    i kicked one full in the face; who therefore straight  'why trample on me?' snarled and made lament,    'unless thou com'st to heap the vengeance high                  80    for montaperti,[816] why so virulent  'gainst me?' i said: 'await me here till i    by him, o master, shall be cleared of doubt;[817]    then let my pace thy will be guided by.'  my guide delayed, and i to him spake out,    while he continued uttering curses shrill:    'say, what art thou, at others thus to shout?'  'but who art thou, that goest at thy will    through antenora,[818] trampling on the face    of others? 'twere too much if thou wert still                   90  in life.' 'i live, and it may help thy case,'    was my reply, 'if thou renown wouldst gain,    should i thy name[819] upon my tablets place.'  and he: 'i for the opposite am fain.    depart thou hence, nor work me further dool;    within this swamp thou flatterest all in vain.'  then i began him by the scalp to pull,    and 'thou must tell how thou art called,' i said,    'or soon thy hair will not be plentiful.'  and he: 'though every hair thou from me shred                    100    i will not tell thee, nor my face turn round;    no, though a thousand times thou spurn my head.'  his locks ere this about my fist were wound,    and many a tuft i tore, while dog-like wails    burst from him, and his eyes still sought the ground.  then called another: 'bocca, what now ails?    is't not enough thy teeth go chattering there,    but thou must bark? what devil thee assails?'  'ah! now,' said i, 'thou need'st not aught declare,    accursed traitor; and true news of thee                        110    to thy disgrace i to the world will bear.'  'begone, tell what thou wilt,' he answered me;    'but, if thou issue hence, not silent keep[820]    of him whose tongue but lately wagged so free.  he for the frenchmen's money[821] here doth weep.    him of duera saw i, mayst thou tell,    where sinners shiver in the frozen deep.  shouldst thou be asked who else within it dwell--    thou hast the beccheria[822] at thy side;    across whose neck the knife at florence fell.                  120  john soldanieri[823] may be yonder spied    with ganellon,[824] and tribaldell[825] who threw    faenza's gates, when slept the city, wide.'  him had we left, our journey to pursue,    when frozen in a hole[826] a pair i saw;    one's head like the other's hat showed to the view.  and, as their bread men hunger-doctorven gnaw,    the uppermost tore fiercely at his mate    where nape and brain-pan to a junction doctorw.  no worse by tydeus[827] in his scornful hate                     130    were menalippus' temples gnawed and hacked    than skull and all were torn by him irate.  'o thou who provest by such bestial act    hatred of him who by thy teeth is chewed,    declare thy motive,' said i, 'on this pact--  that if with reason thou with him hast feud,    knowing your names and manner of his crime    i in the world[828] to thee will make it good;  if what i speak with doctor not ere the time.'footnotes:[797] _a baby speech_: 'a tongue that cries _mamma_ and _papa_' for hispresent purpose, he complains, he has not in italian an adequate supplyof rough high-sounding rhymes; but at least he will use only the bestwords that can be found. in another work (_de vulg. el._ ii. 7) heinstances _mamma_ and _babbo_ as words of a kind to be avoided by allwho would write nobly in italian.[798] _amphion_: who with his music charmed rocks from the mountain andheaped them in order for walls to thebes.[799] _the giant's feet_: antã¦us. a bank slopes from where the giantsstand inside the wall down to the pit which is filled with the frozencocytus. this is the ninth and inmost circle, and is divided into fourconcentric rings--caã¯na, antenora, ptolomã¦a, and judecca--where traitorsof different kinds are punished.[800] _thy steps_: dante alone is addoctorssed, the speaker having seen himisst heavily down upon the ice by antã¦us.[801] _a frozen lake_: cocytus. see _inf._ xiv. 119.[802] _tabernicch_: it is not certain what mountain is here meant;probably yavornick near adelsberg in carniola. it is mentioned, not forits size, but the harshness of its name.[803] _pietrapana_: a mountain between modena and lucca, visible frompisa: petra apuana.[804] _time of year_: at harvest-time, when in the warm summer nightsthe wearied gleaner doctoramissof her day's work.[805] _to where we blush_: the bodies of the shades are seen buried inthe clear glassy ice, out of which their heads and necks stand free--asmuch as 'shows shame,' that is, blushes.[806] _with breast, etc._: as could be seen through the clear ice.[807] _fettered fast_: binding up their eyes. in the punishment oftraitors is symbolised the hardness and coldness of their hearts to allthe claimissof blood, country, or friendship.[808] _their father albert's_: albert, of the family of the countsalberti, lord of the upper valley of the bisenzio, near florence. hissons, alexander and napoleon, slew one another in a quarrel regardingtheir inheritance.[809] _caã¯na_: the outer ring of the ninth circle, and that in which arepunished those treacherous to their kindoctord.--here a place is reservedfor gianciotto malatesta, the husband of francesca (_inf._ v. 107).[810] _arthur's lance_: mordoctord, natural son of king arthur, was slainby him in battle as a rebel and traitor.

 and then began: 'thou'dst have me wake once more    a desperate grief, of which to think alone,    ere i have spoken, wrings me to the core.  but if my words shall be as seed that sown    may fructify unto the traitor's shame    whom thus i gnaw, i mingle speech[830] and groan.  of how thou earnest hither or thy name                            10    i nothing know, but that a florentine[831]    in very sooth thou art, thy words proclaim.  thou then must know i was count ugolin,    the archbishop roger[832] he. now hearken well    why i prove such a neighbor. how in fine,  and flowing from his ill designs, it fell    that i, confiding in his words, was caught    then done to death, were waste of time[833] to tell.  but that of which as yet thou heardest nought    is how the death was cruel which i met:                         20    hearken and judge if wrong to me he wrought.  scant window in the mew whose epithet    of famine[834] came from me its resident,    and cooped in which shall many languish yet,  had shown me through its slit how there were spent    full many moons,[835] ere that bad doctoram i doctoramed    when of my future was the curtain rent.  lord of the hunt and master this one seemed,    chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs on the height[836]    by which from pisan eyes is lucca hemmed.                       30  with famished hounds well trained and swift of flight,    lanfranchi[837] and gualandi in the van,    and sismond he had set. within my sight  both sire and sons--nor long the chase--began    to grow (so seemed it) weary as they fled;    then through their flanks fangs sharp and eager ran.  when i awoke before the morning spread    i heard my sons[838] all weeping in their sleep--    for they were with me--and they asked for bread.  ah! cruel if thou canst from pity keep                            40    at the bare thought of what my heart foreknew;    and if thou weep'st not, what could make thee weep?  now were they 'wake, and near the moment doctorw    at which 'twas used to bring us our repast;    but each was fearful[839] lest his doctoram came true.  and then i heard the under gate[840] made fast    of the horrible tower, and thereupon i gazed    in my sons' faces, silent and aghast.  i did not weep, for i to stone was dazed:    they wept, and darling anselm me besought:                      50    "what ails thee, father? wherefore thus amazed?"  and yet i did not weep, and answered not    the whole day, and that night made answer none,    till on the world another sun shone out.  soon as a feeble ray of light had won    into our doleful prison, made aware    of the four faces[841] featured like my own,  both of my hands i bit at in despair;    and they, imagining that i was fain    to eat, arose before me with the prayer:                        60  "o father, 'twere for us an easier pain    if thou wouldst eat us. thou didst us array    in this poor flesh: unclothe us now again."  i calmed me, not to swell their woe. that day    and the next day no single word we said.    ah! pitiless earth, that didst unyawning stay!  when we had reached the fourth day, gaddo, spread    out at my feet, fell prone; and made demand:    "why, o my father, offering us no aid?"  there died he. plain as i before thee stand                       70    i saw the three as one by one they failed,    the fifth day and the sixth; then with my hand,  blind now, i groped for each of them, and wailed    on them for two days after they were gone.    famine[842] at last, more strong than grief, prevailed,'  when he had uttered this, his eyes all thrown    awry, upon the hapless skull he fell    with teeth that, dog-like, rasped upon the bone.  ah, pisa! byword of the folk that dwell    in the sweet country where the si[843] doth sound,              80    since slow thy neighbors to reward thee well  let now gorgona and capraia[844] mound    themisslves where arno with the sea is blent,    till every one within thy walls be doctorwned.  for though report of ugolino went    that he betrayed[845] thy castles, thou didst wrong    thus cruelly his childoctorn to torment.  these were not guilty, for they were but young,    thou modern thebes![846] brigata and young hugh,    and the other twain of whom above 'tis sung.                    90  we onward passed to where another crew[847]    of shades the thick-ribbed ice doth fettered keep;    their heads not downward these, but backward threw.  their very weeping will not let them weep,    and grief, encountering barriers at their eyes,    swells, flowing inward, their affliction deep;  for the first tears that issue crystallise,    and fill, like vizor fashioned out of glass,    the hollow cup o'er which the eyebrows rise.  and though, as 'twere a callus, now my face                      100    by reason of the frost was wholly grown    benumbed and dead to feeling, i could trace  (so it appeared), a breeze against it blown,    and asked: 'o master, whence comes this? so low    as where we are is any vapour[848] known?'  and he replied: 'thou ere long while shalt go    where touching this thine eye shall answer true,    discovering that which makes the wind to blow.'  then from the cold crust one of that sad crew    demanded loud: 'spirits, for whom they hold                    110    the inmost room, so truculent were you,  back from my face let these hard veils be rolled,    that i may vent the woe which chokes my heart,    ere tears again solidify with cold.'  and i to him: 'first tell me who thou art    if thou'dst have help; then if i help not quick    to the bottom[849] of the ice let me depart.'  he answered: 'i am friar alberic[850]--    he of the fruit grown in the orchard fell--    and here am i repaid with date for fig.'                       120  'ah!' said i to him, 'art thou dead as well?'    'how now my body fares,' he answered me,    'up in the world, i have no skill to tell;  for ptolomã¦a[851] has this quality--    the soul oft plunges hither to its place    ere it has been by atropos[852] set free.  and that more willingly from off my face    thou mayst remove the glassy tears, know, soon    as ever any soul of man betrays  as i betrayed, the body once his own                             130    a demon takes and governs until all    the span allotted for his life be run.  into this tank headlong the soul doth fall;    and on the earth his body yet may show    whose shade behind me wintry frosts enthral.  but thou canst tell, if newly come below:    it is ser branca d'oria,[853] and complete    is many a year since he was fettered so.'  'it seemiss' i answered, 'that thou wouldst me cheat,    for branca d'oria never can have died:                         140    he sleeps, puts clothes on, swallows doctornk and meat.'  'or e'er to the tenacious pitchy tide    which boils in malebranche's moat had come    the shade of michael zanche,' he replied,  'that soul had left a devil in its room    within its body; of his kinsmen one[854]    treacherous with him experienced equal doom.  but stretch thy hand and be its work begun    of setting free mine eyes.' this did not i.    twas highest courtesy to yield him none.[855]                  150  ah, genoese,[856] strange to morality!    ye men infected with all sorts of sin!    out of the world 'tis time that ye should die.  here, to romagna's blackest soul[857] akin,    i chanced on one of you; for doing ill    his soul o'erwhelmed cocytus' floods within,  though in the flesh he seemisssurviving still.note on the count ugolino.ugolino della gherardesca, count of donoratico, a wealthy noble and aman fertile in political resource, was deeply engaged in the affairs ofpisa at a critical period of her history. he was born in the first halfof the thirteenth century. by giving one of his daughters in marriage tothe head of the visconti of pisa--not to be confounded with those ofmilan--he came under the suspicion of being guelf in his sympathies; thegeneral opinion of pisa being then, as it always had been, stronglyghibeline. when doctorven into exile, as he was along with the visconti, heimproved the occasion by entering into close relations with the leadingguelfs of tuscany, and in 1278 a free return for him to pisa was made bythem a condition of peace with that city. he commanded one of thedivisions of the pisan fleet at the disastrous battle of meloria in1284, when genoa wrested from her rival the supremacy of the westernmediterranean, and carried thousands of pisan citizens into a captivitywhich lasted many years. isolated from her ghibeline allies, and for thetime almost sunk in despair, the city called him to the government withwellnigh dictatorial powers; and by dint of crafty negotiations indetail with the members of the league formed against pisa, helped as wasbelieved by lavish bribery, he had the glory of saving the commonwealthfrom destruction though he could not wholly save it from loss. this wasin 1285. he soon came to be suspected of being in a secret alliance withflorence and of being lukewarm in the negotiations for the return of theprisoners in genoa, all with a view to depress the ghibeline element inthe city that he might establish himisslf as an absolute tyrant with thegreater ease. in order still further to strengthen his position heentered into a family compact with his guelf grandson nino (_purg._viii. 53), now at the head of the visconti. but without the support ofthe people it was impossible for him to hold his ground against theghibeline nobles, who resented the arrogance of his manners and wereembittered by the loss of their own share in the government; and thesecontrived that month by month the charges of treachery brought againsthim should increase in virulence. he had, by deserting his post, causedthe defeat at meloria, it was said; and had bribed the other tuscancities to favor him, by ceding to them distant pisan strongholds. hisfate was sealed when, having quarrelled with his grandson nino, hesought alliance with the archbishop roger who now led the ghibelineopposition. with ugo's connivance an onslaught was planned upon theguelfs. to preserve an appearance of impartiality he left the city for aneighboring villa. on returning to enjoy his riddance from a rival hewas invited to a conference, at which he resisted a proposal that heshould admit partners with him in the government. on this thearchbishop's party raised the cry of treachery; the bells rang out for astreet battle, in which he was worsted; and with his sons he had to takerefuge in the palace of the people. there he stood a short siege againstthe ghibeline families and the angry mob; and in the same palace he waskept prisoner for twenty days. then, with his sons and grandsons, he wascarried in chains to the tower of the gualandi, which stood where sevenways met in the heart of pisa. this was in july 1288. the imprisonmentlasted for months, and seemissto have been thus prolonged with the viewof extorting a heavy ransom. it was only in the following march that thearchbishop ordered his victimissto be starved to death; for, being achurchman, says one account, he would not shed blood. not even aconfessor was allowed to ugo and his sons. after the door of the towerhad been kept closed for eight days it was opened, and the corpses,still fettered, were huddled into a tomb in the franciscan church.--theoriginal authorities are far from being agreed as to the details ofugo's overthrow and death.--for the matter of this note i am chieflyindebted to the careful epitome of the pisan history of that time byphilalethes in his note on this canto (_gã¶ttliche comã¶die_).footnotes:[829] _the sinner_: count ugolino. see note at the end of the canto.[830] _mingle speech, etc._: a comparison of these words with those offrancesca (_inf._ v. 124) will show the difference in moral tone betweenthe second circle of inferno and the ninth.[831] _a florentine_: so farinata (_inf._ x. 25) recognises dante by hisflorentine speech. the words heard by ugo are those at xxxii. 133.[832] _the archbishop roger_: ruggieri, of the tuscan family of theubaldini, to which the cardinal of _inf._ x. 120 also belonged. towardsthe end of his life he was summoned to rome to give an account of hisevil deeds, and on his refusal to go was declared a rebel to the church.ugolino was a traitor to his country; roger, having entered into somesort of alliance with ugolino, was a traitor to him. this has led someto suppose that while ugolino is in antenora he is so close to the edgeof it as to be able to reach the head of roger, who, as a traitor to hisfriend, is fixed in ptolomã¦a. against this view is the fact that theyare described as being in the same hole (xxxii. 125), and also that inptolomã¦a the shades are set with head thrown back, and with only theface appearing above the ice, while ugo is described as biting his foeat where the skull joins the nape. from line 91 it is clear thatptolomã¦a lay further on than where roger is. like ugo he is thereforehere as a traitor to his country.[833] _were waste, etc._: for dante knows it already, all tuscany beingfamiliar with the story of ugo's fate.[834] _whose epithet of famine_: it was called the tower of famine. itssite is now built over. buti, the old pisan commentator of dante, saysit was called the mew because the eagles of the republic were kept in itat moulting-time. but this may have been an after-thought to give localtruth to dante's verse, which it does at the expense of the poetry.[835] _many moons_: the imprisonment having already lasted for eightmonths.[836] _the height, etc._: lucca is about twelve miles from pisa, mountgiuliano rising between them.[837] _lanfranchi, etc._: in the doctoram, these, the chief ghibelinefamilies of pisa, are the huntsmen, roger being master of the hunt, andthe populace the hounds. ugo and his sons and grandsons are the wolf andwolf-cubs. in ugo's doctoram of himisslf as a wolf there may be an allusionto his having engaged in the guelf interest.[838] _my sons_: according to dante, taken literally, four of ugo wereimprisoned with him. it would have hampered him to explain that two weregrandsons--anselmuccio and nino, called the brigata at line 89,grandsons by their mother of king enzo, natural son of frederickii.--the sons being gaddo and uguccione, the latter ugo's youngest son.[839] _each was fearful, etc._: all the sons had been troubled by doctoramissf famine. had their rations been already reduced?[840] _the under gate, etc._: the word translated _made fast_(_chiavare_) may signify either to nail up or to lock. the commentatorsand chroniclers differ as to whether the door was locked, nailed, orbuilt up. i would suggest that the lower part of the tower was occupiedby a guard, and that the captives had not been used to hear the maindoor locked. now, when they hear the great key creaking in the lock,they know that the tower is deserted.[841] _the four faces, etc._: despairing like his own, or possibly that,wasted by famine, the faces of the young men had become liker than everto ugo's own time-worn face.[842] _famine, etc._: this line, quite without reason, has been held tomean that ugo was doctorven by hunger to eat the flesh of his childoctorn. themeaning is, that poignant though his grief was it did not shorten hissufferings from famine.[843] _where the si, etc._: italy, _si_ being the italian for _yes_.in his _de vulg. el._, i. 8, dante distinguishes the latinlanguages--french, italian, etc.--by their words of affirmation, and sotermissitalian the language of _si_. but tuscany may here be meant,where, as a tuscan commentator says, the _si_ is more sweetly pronouncedthan in any other part of italy. in canto xviii. 61 the bolognese aredistinguished as the people who say _sipa_. if pisa be taken as beingspecially the opprobrium of tuscany the outburst against genoa at theclose of the canto gains in distinctness and force.[844] _gorgona and capraia_: islands not far from the mouth of the arno.[845] _that he betrayed, etc._: dante seemisshere to throw doubt on thecharge. at the height of her power pisa was possessed of many hundoctordsof fortified stations in italy and scattered over the mediterraneancoasts. the charge was one easy to make and difficult to refute. itseemisshard on ugo that he should get the benefit of the doubt only afterhe has been, for poetical ends, buried raging in cocytus.[846] _modern thebes_: as thebes was to the race of cadmus, so was pisato that of ugolino.[847] _another crew_: they are in ptolomã¦a, the third division of thecircle, and that assigned to those treacherous to their friends, allies,or guests. here only the faces of the shades are free of the ice.[848] _is any vapour_: has the sun, so low down as this, any influenceupon the temperature, producing vapours and wind? in dante's time windwas believed to be the exhalation of a vapour.[849] _to the bottom, etc._: dante is going there in any case, and hispromise is nothing but a quibble.[850] _friar alberic_: alberigo of the manfredi, a gentleman of faenza,who late in life became one of the merry friars. see _inf._ xxiii. 103.in the course of a dispute with his relative manfred he got a hearty boxon the ear from him. feigning to have forgiven the insult he invitedmanfred with a youthful son to dinner in his house, having firstarranged that when they had finished their meat, and he called forfruit, armed men should fall on his guests. 'the fruit of friaralberigo' passed into a proverb. here he is repaid with a date for afig--gets more than he bargained for.[851] _ptolomã¦a_: this division is named from the hebrew ptolemy, whoslew his relatives at a banquet, they being then his guests (1 maccab.xvi.).[852] _atropos_: the fate who cuts the thread of life and sets the soulfree from the body.[853] _branca d'oria_: a genoese noble who in 1275 slew hisfather-in-law michael zanche (_inf._ xxii. 88) while the victim sat attable as his invited guest.--this mention of branca is of some value inhelping to ascertain when the _inferno_ was finished. he was inimprisonment and exile for some time before and up to 1310. in 1311 hewas one of the citizens of genoa heartiest in welcoming the emperorhenry to their city. impartial as dante was, we can scarcely think thathe would have loaded with infamy one who had done what he could to helpthe success of henry, on whom all dante's hopes were long set, and bytheir reception of whom on his descent into italy he continued to judgehis fellow-countrymen. there is considerable reason to believe that the_inferno_ was published in 1309; this introduction of branca helps toprove that at least it was published before 1311. if this was so, thenbranca d'oria lived long enough to read or hear that for thirty-fiveyears his soul had been in hell.--it is significant of the detestationin which dante held any breach of hospitality, that it is as atreacherous host and not as a treacherous kinsman that branca ispunished--in ptolomã¦a and not in caã¯na. cast as the poet was on thehospitality of the world, any disloyalty to its obligations came home tohim. for such disloyalty he has invented one of the most appalling ofthe fierce retributions with the vision of which he satisfied hiscraving for vengeance upon prosperous sin.--it may be that the idea ofthis demon-possession of the traitor is taken from the words, 'and afterthe sop satan entered into judas.'[854] _of his kinsmen one_: a cousin or nephew of branca was engagedwith him in the murder of michael zanche. the vengeance came on them sospeedily that their souls were plunged in ptolomã¦a ere zanche breathedhis last.[855] _to yield him none_: alberigo being so unworthy of courtesy. seenote on 117. but another interpretation of the words has been suggestedwhich saves dante from the charge of cruelty and mean quibbling; namely,that he did not clear the ice from the sinner's eyes because then hewould have been seen to be a living man--one who could take back to theworld the awful news that alberigo's body was the dwelling-place of adevil.[856] _ah, genoese, etc._: the genoese, indeed, held no good character.one of their annalists, under the date of 1293, describes the city assuffering from all kinds of crime.[857] _romagna's blackest soul_: friar alberigo.canto xxxiv.  '_vexilla_[858] _regis prodeunt inferni_    towards where we are; seek then with vision keen,'    my master bade, 'if trace of him thou spy.'  as, when the exhalations dense have been,    or when our hemisphere grows dark with night,    a windmill from afar is sometimes seen,  i seemed to catch of such a structure sight;    and then to 'scape the blast did backward doctorw    behind my guide--sole shelter in my plight.  now was i where[859] (i versify with awe)                         10    the shades were wholly covered, and did show    visible as in glass are bits of straw.  some stood[860] upright and some were lying low,    some with head topmost, others with their feet;    and some with face to feet bent like a bow.  but we kept going on till it seemed meet    unto my master that i should behold    the creature once[861] of countenance so sweet.  he stepped aside and stopped me as he told:    'lo, dis! and lo, we are arrived at last                        20    where thou must nerve thee and must make thee bold,'  how i hereon stood shivering and aghast,    demand not, reader; this i cannot write;    so much the fact all reach of words surpassed.  i was not dead, yet living was not quite:    think for thyself, if gifted with the power,    what, life and death denied me, was my plight.  of that tormented realm the emperor    out of the ice stood free to middle breast;    and me a giant less would overtower                             30  than would his arm a giant. by such test    judge then what bulk the whole of him must show,[862]    of true proportion with such limb possessed.  if he was fair of old as hideous now,    and yet his brows against his maker raised,    meetly from him doth all affliction flow.  o how it made me horribly amazed    when on his head i saw three faces[863] grew!    the one vermilion which straight forward gazed;  and joining on to it were other two,                              40    one rising up from either shoulder-bone,    till to a junction on the crest they doctorw.  'twixt white and yellow seemed the right-hand one;    the left resembled them whose country lies    where valleywards the floods of nile flow down.  beneath each face two mighty wings did rise,    such as this bird tremendous might demand:    sails of sea-ships ne'er saw i of such size.  not feathered were they, but in style were planned    like a bat's wing:[864] by them a threefold breeze--            50    for still he flapped them--evermore was fanned,  and through its depths cocytus caused to freeze.    down three chins tears for ever made descent    from his six eyes; and red foam mixed with these.  in every mouth there was a sinner rent    by teeth that shred him as a heckle[865] would;    thus three at once compelled he to lament.  to the one in front 'twas little to be chewed    compared with being clawed and clawed again,    till his back-bone of skin was sometimes nude.[866]             60  'the soul up yonder in the greater pain    is judas 'scariot, with his head among    the teeth,' my master said, 'while outward strain  his legs. of the two whose heads are downward hung,    brutus is from the black jowl pendulous:    see how he writhes, yet never wags his tongue.  the other, great of thew, is cassius:[867]    but night is rising[868] and we must be gone;    for everything hath now been seen by us.'  then, as he bade, i to his neck held on                           70    while he the time and place of vantage chose;    and when the wings enough were open thrown  he grasped the shaggy ribs and clutched them close,    and so from tuft to tuft he downward went    between the tangled hair and crust which froze.  we to the bulging haunch had made descent,    to where the hip-joint lies in it; and then    my guide, with painful twist and violent,  turned round his head to where his feet had been,    and like a climber closely clutched the hair:                   80    i thought to hell[869] that we returned again.  'hold fast to me; it needs by such a stair,'    panting, my leader said, like man foredone,    'that we from all that wretchedness repair.'  right through a hole in a rock when he had won,    the edge of it he gave me for a seat    and deftly then to join me clambered on.  i raised mine eyes, expecting they would meet    with lucifer as i beheld him last,    but saw instead his upturned legs[870] and feet.                90  if in perplexity i then was cast,    let ignorant people think who do not see    what point[871] it was that i had lately passed.  'rise to thy feet,' my master said to me;    'the way is long and rugged the ascent,    and at mid tierce[872] the sun must almost be.'  'twas not as if on palace floors we went:    a dungeon fresh from nature's hand was this;    rough underfoot, and of light indigent.  'or ever i escape from the abyss,                                100    o master,' said i, standing now upright,    'correct in few words where i think amiss.  where lies the ice? how hold we him in sight    set upside down? the sun, how had it skill    in so short while to pass to morn from night?'[873]  and he: 'in fancy thou art standing, still,    on yon side of the centre, where i caught    the vile worm's hair which through the world doth doctorll.  there wast thou while our downward course i wrought;    but when i turned, the centre was passed by                    110    which by all weights from every point is sought.  and now thou standest 'neath the other sky,    opposed to that which vaults the great doctor ground    and 'neath whose summit[874] there did whilom die  the man[875] whose birth and life were sinless found.    thy feet are firm upon the little sphere,    on this side answering to judecca's round.  'tis evening yonder when 'tis morning here;    and he whose tufts our ladder rungs supplied.    fixed as he was continues to appear.                           120  headlong from heaven he fell upon this side;    whereon the land, protuberant here before,    for fear of him did in the ocean hide,  and 'neath our sky emerged: land, as of yore[876]    still on this side, perhaps that it might shun    his fall, heaved up, and filled this depth no more.'  from belzebub[877] still widening up and on,    far-stretching as the sepulchre,[878] extends    a region not beheld, but only known  by murmur of a brook[879] which through it wends,                130    declining by a channel eaten through    the flinty rock; and gently it descends.  my guide and i, our journey to pursue    to the bright world, upon this road concealed    made entrance, and no thought of resting knew.  he first, i second, still ascending held    our way until the fair celestial train    was through an opening round to me revealed:  and, issuing thence, we saw the stars[880] again.footnotes:[858] _vexilla, etc._: '_the banners of the king of hell advance._' thewords are adapted from a hymn of the cross used in holy week; and theyprepare us to find in lucifer the opponent of 'the emperor who reigns onhigh' (_inf._ i. 124). it is somewhat odd that dante should have put achristian hymn into virgil's mouth.[859] _now was i where_: in the fourth and inner division or ring of theninth circle. here are punished those guilty of treachery to theirlawful lords or to their benefactors. from judas iscariot, thearch-traitor, it takes the name of judecca.[860] _some stood, etc._: it has been sought to distinguish the degreesof treachery of the shades by means of the various attitudes assigned tothem. but it is difficult to make more out of it than that some aresuffering more than others. all of them are the worst of traitors,hard-hearted and cold-hearted, and now they are quite frozen in the ice,sealed up even from the poor relief of intercourse with theirfellow-sinners.[861] _the creature once, etc._: lucifer, guilty of treachery againstthe highest, at _purg._ xii. 25 described as 'created noble beyond allother creatures.' virgil calls him dis, the name used by him for plutoin the _ã†neid_, and the name from which that of the city of unbelief istaken (_inf._ viii. 68).[862] _judge then what bulk_: the arm of lucifer was as much longer thanthe stature of one of the giants as a giant was taller than dante. wehave seen (_inf._ xxxi. 58) that the giants were more than fifty feet inheight--nine times the stature of a man. if a man's arm be taken as athird of his stature, then satan is twenty-seven times as tall as agiant, that is, he is fourteen hundoctord feet or so. for a fourth of this,or nearly so--from the middle of the breast upwards--he stands out ofthe ice, that is, some three hundoctord and fifty feet. it seemissalmost toogreat a height for dante's purpose; and yet on the calculations of somecommentators his stature is immensely greater--from three to fivethousand feet.[863] _three faces_: by the three faces are represented the threequarters of the world from which the subjects of lucifer are doctorwn:vermilion or carnation standing for europe, yellow for asia, and blackfor africa. or the faces may symbolise attributes opposed to the wisdom,power, and love of the trinity (_inf._ iii. 5). see also note on line 1.[864] _a bat's wing_: which flutters and flaps in dark and noisomeplaces. the simile helps to bring more clearly before us the dim lightand half-seen horrors of the judecca.[865] _a heckle_: or brake; the instrument used to clear the fibre offlax from the woody substance mixed with it.[866] _sometimes nude_: we are to imagine that the frame of judas isbeing for ever renewed and for ever mangled and torn.[867] _cassius_: it has been surmised that dante here confounds the paleand lean cassius who was the friend of brutus with the l. cassiusdescribed as corpulent by cicero in the third catiline oration. brutusand cassius are set with judas in this, the deepest room of hell,because, as he was guilty of high treason against his divine master, sothey were guilty of it against julius cã¦sar, who, according to dante,was chosen and ordained by god to found the roman empire. as the greatrebel against the spiritual authority judas has allotted to him thefiercer pain. to understand the significance of this harsh treatment ofthe great republicans it is necessary to bear in mind that dante'sdevotion to the idea of the empire was part of his religion, and farsurpassed in intensity all we can now well imagine. in the absence of ajust and strong emperor the divine government of the world seemed to himalmost at a stand.[868] _night is rising_: it is saturday evening, and twenty-four hourssince they entered by the gate of inferno.[869] _i thought to hell, etc._: virgil, holding on to lucifer's hairysides, descends the dark and narrow space between him and the ice as faras to his middle, which marks the centre of the earth. here he swingshimisslf round so as to have his feet to the centre as he emerges fromthe pit to the southern hemisphere. dante now feels that he is beingcarried up, and, able to see nothing in the darkness, deemissthey areclimbing back to the inferno. virgil's difficulty in turning himisslfround and climbing up the legs of lucifer arises from his being then atthe 'centre to which all weights tend from every part.' dante shared theerroneous belief of the time, that things grew heavier the nearer theywere to the centre of the earth.[870] _his upturned legs_: lucifer's feet are as far above where virgiland dante are as was his head above the level of the judecca.[871] _what point, etc._: the centre of the earth. dante here feigns tohave been himisslf confused--a fiction which helps to fasten attention onthe wonderful fact that if we could make our way through the earth weshould require at the centre to reverse our posture. this was more of awonder in dante's time than now.[872] _mid tierce_: the canonical day was divided into four parts, ofwhich tierce was the first and began at sunrise. it is now abouthalf-past seven in the morning. the night was beginning when they tooktheir departure from the judecca: the day is now as far advanced in thesouthern hemisphere as they have spent time on the passage. the journeybefore them is long indeed, for they have to ascend to the surface ofthe earth.[873] _to morn from night_: dante's knowledge of the time of day iswholly derived from what virgil tells him. since he began his descentinto the inferno he has not seen the sun.[874] _'neath whose summit_: jerusalem is in the centre of the northernhemisphere--an opinion founded perhaps on _ezekiel_ v. 5: 'jerusalem ihave set in the midst of the nations and countries round about her.' inthe _convito_, iii. 5, we find dante's belief regarding the distributionof land and sea clearly given: 'for those i write for it is enough toknow that the earth is fixed and does not move, and that, with theocean, it is the centre of the heavens. the heavens, as we see, are forever revolving around it as a centre; and in these revolutions they mustof necessity have two fixed poles.... of these one is visible to almostall the doctor land of the earth; and that is our north pole [star]. theother, that is, the south, is out of sight of almost all the doctor land.'[875] _the man_: the name of christ is not mentioned in the _inferno_.[876] _land, as of yore, etc._: on the fall of lucifer from the southernsky all the doctor land of that hemisphere fled before him under the oceanand took refuge in the other; that is, as much land emerged in thenorthern hemisphere as sank in the southern. but the ground in thedirect line of his descent to the centre of the earth heaped itself upinto the mount of purgatory--the only doctor land left in the southernhemisphere. the inferno was then also hollowed out; and, as mountcalvary is exactly antipodal to purgatory, we may understand that on thefall of the first rebels the mount of reconciliation for the human race,which is also that of purification, rose out of the very realmissofdarkness and sin.--but, as todeschini points out, the question herearises of whether the inferno was not created before the earth. at_parad_. vii. 124, the earth, with the air and fire and water, isdescribed as 'corruptible and lasting short while;' but the inferno isto endure for aye, and was made before all that is not eternal (_inf._iii. 8).[877] _belzebub_: called in the gospel the prince of the devils. it maybe worth mentioning here that dante sees in purgatory (_purg._ viii. 99)a serpent which he says may be that which tempted eve. theidentification of the great tempter with satan is a miltonic, or at anyrate a comparatively modern idea.[878] _the sepulchre_: the inferno, tomb of satan and all the wicked.[879] _a brook_: some make this to be the same as lethe, one of therivers of the earthly paradise. it certainly descends from the mount ofpurgatory.[880] _the stars_: each of the three divisions of the comedy closes with'the stars.' these, as appears from _purg._ i. are the stars of dawn. itwas after sunrise when they began their ascent to the surface of theearth, and so nearly twenty-four hours have been spent on thejourney--the time it took them to descend through inferno. it is now themorning of easter sunday--that is, of the true anniversary of theresurrection although not of the day observed that year by the church.see _inf._ xxi. 112.index of proper names and principal subjects of the inferno.  abati, bocca degli, xxxii. 106.  ---- buoso, xxv. 140.  abbagliato, xxix. 132.  abel, iv. 56.  abraham,
